# The Basics

Assets have a specific use case. A weapon can be used to attack with [Fight](/skill-list#fight), a horse can be used to travel distances with [Maneuver](/skill-list#maneuver) or [Wilderness](/skill-list#wilderness), an aristocrat's written favor may be used with [Influence](/skill-list#influence) at court, etc.

Each asset has a quality rating. Usually, this rating is between **1** and **3.** Some special asset such as castles might exceed a quality rating of **3.**

An asset may be used in one of two ways. You may only use a single asset on a roll, and you may only use an asset in only one of these two ways this way.

- After rolling with a fitting skill and if the number of the successes rolled is lower than the asset's rating, treat the roll as if you had rolled successes equal to the asset's rating. After you use an asset, its quality rating degrades by **1.**

- Add half of its rating (rounded down) as dice to your roll. When you do, the asset also degrades.

If an asset's quality rating drops to 0, it can no longer be used.

When you use an asset to increase your successes, but you still fail at the test, the asset does not increase the [Favor](/character#favor) you gain. You only get Favor for successes you have actually rolled.

**Off-label Usage:** When using an asset for with skill other than its intended purpose, its rating is considered to be halved (rounded down) for that test. When using an asset with an [Attribute](/character#attributes) other than its intended purpose, its rating is considered to be halved (rounded down) for that test. After rounding down, an asset's rating is always at least **1.** If an asset is not intended for a use case but just makes perfect sense in the narrative at that moment, the GM may allow you to use an asset without halving its rating.

**Masterwork:** A asset does not degrade if its rating is more than double the number of successes required to succeed on the test it is used.

Assets may have additional properties such as weapons being able to be used as assets for other skills than Fight or granting other boons or have traits of their own (see [Gear](/gear)).

You may buy new assets and create new assets or improve assets you already own (see [Resting](/conditions-and-resting#crafting)).

> Maro finds himself in a skirmish with a vicious assassin who ambushed him. Maro attacks with his axe, though luck isn't in his favor, and he rolls **0** successes. His opponent rolled **1** success. He is quick and threatens to deflect the blow. Maro may now use his `Axe` asset with a quality rating of **2** to treat the roll as if he had rolled **2** successes. If he does, the asset degrades as he drives the axe into his opponent's armor and the axe loses **1** quality rating. It now has a quality rating of **1** but the assassin suffered a mean wound to the chest.
