# Conditions

Conditions are temporary but unavoidable negative consequences of your daring adventures. They will get in your way and, with time, accumulate if not looked after. And worst of all, they will help the blackguards who cross your way until you get rid of them.

There are three different types of conditions: physical, mental, and social conditions (see [Condition Types](#condition-types)). When the rules call for an _appropriate_ Condition, they reference the different types of conditions, as not all conditions will hinder you on every test.

Uncontested test always have a minimum difficulty equal to the highest rating of your appropriate conditions. If an uncontested test already has a higher difficulty, your conditions do not increase it.

During contests, your opponents may use your conditions to their advantage. Your opponent's minimum effort when testing against you is equal to the highest rating of your appropriate conditions.  
You may use your opponents' conditions against them to gain minimum effort in the same way as your opponent's can use yours against you.


# Condition Slots

You have **6** slots for three different kinds of conditions. When you receive a new Condition, fill any available, empty slot with rating equal to or greater that Condition's rating. A Condition in a slot always has the slot's rating.

Any of the three different Condition types — physical, mental, and social — fit into any of your available slots.

Should you receive a Condition for which you do not have any empty slots, increase that conditions rating by **1** and try again until you find a slot with rating of at least that Condition's rating.  
If you cannot find any empty slot to note your Condition, either because the conditions rating is too high or because you have no more slots available, you are in deep trouble:

- During conflicts, if the Condition's rating is **3** or less, you may spend **1** Favor to, instead of taking the Condition, take a new trait with rating equal to the Condition's rating detailing your permanent injury you suffered and escaped by a hair's breadth. You are removed from the conflict.
- Otherwise, whatever has been gnawing at you, finally overwhelms you. Be it blood loss, drowning, permanent imprisonment, succumbing to sickness, execution, madness, or complete social ostrezitation, and you must retire your character.

You can reduce the rating of your conditions by tending to them (see [Recovering](#recovering)). conditions only ever reduce their rating, never increase it.  
When a Condition's rating changes, move it to an empty slot of the new rating. If you do not have an empty slot of the appropriate rating, the Condition does not change.  
When a Condition's rating is reduced to **0**, it vanishes.


### Minor Conditions (Rating 1)

You have **3** slots for minor conditions.

These conditions are minor inconveniences. Superficial cuts, bruised egos, a revolting appearance after days of adventuring, and similar troubles, that arise with living an interesting life, are minor conditions. Nothing that cannot heal or mend with even just a little resting.

As an uncontested test's difficulty is always at least **1** and most foes you will encounter will be armed, so these kinds of conditions are more nuisance than hindrance (unless they begin to pile up and fill your Condition slots).


### Moderate Conditions (Rating 2)

You have **2** slots for moderate conditions.

These conditions are moderate setbacks. Flesh wounds, enduring exhaustion, nightmare-inducing disturbances, being accused of a crime, and similar troubles are moderate conditions.


### Major Conditions (Rating 3)

You have **1** slot for a major Condition.

These conditions are grievous injuries which threaten to fester and prematurely end your journey should they not get immediate attention. Stab wounds to the gut, feverish sickness, debilitating delusions, complete ostrezitation, and similar threats to your character's life are major conditions.



# Condition Types

There are three types of conditions: physical, mental, and social.

## Physical Conditions

These conditions encompass all types of physical trauma, bodily injury and weariness. A cut from a blade is a physical Condition, so is exhaustion from excessive travelling, and so are sickness and poisoning.

Physical conditions always will hinder you on Fight, Maneuver, Wilderness, and Craft tests. Wounds nor exhaustion get in the way of your concentration and coordination.

Physical conditions never hinder you on Influence and Resource tests.

While resting, you can mend physical conditions by testing Craft, though not all ratings can be mended with all [Attributes](/character#attributes).

- **Minor physical conditions can be mended with any attribute.**
- **Moderate physical conditions can be mended with Intuition and Reason.** Some sense for field dressing or at least attentive care are required for these kinds of wounds.
- **Major physical conditions can only be mended with Reason.** Practiced surgery is required to close these kinds of wounds.


## Mental Conditions

These conditions encompass all types of mental trauma, spiritual injury, and weariness of the mind. A biting insult to your character is a mental Condition, so is exhaustion from excessive research, and so are fear and confusion.

Mental conditions always will hinder you on Influence, Maneuver, and Fight tests. Your nerves always surface in the clutch moments, at the most importune times, and they always get in the way of your composure.

Major mental conditions hinder you on all tests. There is no running from your delusions and greatest fears.

While resting, you can mend mental conditions by testing Influence, though not all ratings can be mended with all Approaches.

- **Minor mental conditions can be mended by Influence with any Approach.**
- **Moderate mental conditions can be mended by Influence with Vigor and Intuition but not by Reason.** Some sense of genuine compassion or at least a warming presence is required for these troubles.
- **Major mental conditions can only be mended by Influence with Intuition.** Heartfelt empathy is required to tackle these troubles.


## Social Conditions

These conditions encompass all types of societal rejection, injury to your reputation, and emptiness of the purse. The result of a successful slander campaign is a social Condition, so is seclusion (willing or otherwise) from larger society, and so are debts, and being covered in muck.

Social conditions always will hinder you on Craft and Resource tests. Being cut off from the currents of society strains not only the purse but also cuts off the artisan from their supplies and a bad first — or even worse, lasting — impression is an uphill battle when making your case.

Social conditions never hinder you on Fight, Maneuver, and Wilderness tests.

While resting in a settlement, you can mend social conditions with Resource tests, though not all ratings can be mended with all Approaches.

- **Minor social conditions can be mended by Resources with any Approach.**
- **Moderate social conditions can be mended by Resources with Vigor and Reason but not by Intuition.** Fame, Wealth, rigorous bookkeeping, or a sound argument before a court are required to get out of these predicaments.
- **Major social conditions can only be mended by Resources with Vigor.** Nobility, a made name, or chests of gold are required to get out of these predicaments.



# conditions in Overview

- There are physical, mental, and social conditions. 
- You have **3** slots for minor conditions, **2** for moderate conditions, and **1** for a major Condition. 
- conditions can be mended by resting. 
- Tests you encounter will have a minimum difficulty equal to your highest appropriate Condition.

### Appropriate conditions

The rules on when a Condition hinders you on which kind of test are supposed to be a solid foundation to operate on. As conditions are named after the circumstance they were inflicted, a Condition's name might suggest that it should be applicable in even broader circumstances.

Mental conditions are a prime example that might hinder you in almost any circumstance, even if the Condition is not major.
Or, for example, a social Condition marking you as a wanted for a gruesome murder might even hinder you on Wilderness tests as the tales of your misdeeds travelled across the land and no one you meet on the road is willing to help you, even getting in your way, and you must keep from the travelled road.

This table is meant as a guide, the table's judgement is the ultimate authority if a Condition will hinder you and, of course, you can almost always voluntarily hinder yourself with your own conditions if you find it appropriate.

|                | Physical Hinders | Mental Hinders | Social Hinders |
|----------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| **Influence**  |        -         |    **All**     |    **All**     |
| **Fight**      |     **All**      |    **All**     |       -        |
| **Maneuver**   |     **All**      |    **All**     |       -        |
| **Wilderness** |     **All**      |  _Only Major_  |       -        |
| **Craft**      |     **All**      |  _Only Major_  |    **All**     |
| **Resources**  |        -         |  _Only Major_  |    **All**     |

### Mending conditions

The three different types of conditions have restrictions with which skill and which attribute they can be mended.

[Leisure Structures](/supply-rating#leisure-structures) can give you additional options to get rid of your conditions but on the road or without help, these are the only ways to get rid of conditions.

|              |  Physical Mended By  |  Mental Mended By   | Social Mended By |
|--------------|:--------------------:|:-------------------:|:----------------:|
| **Skill**    |      **Craft**       |    **Influence**    |  **Resources**   |
| **Minor**    |       **All**        | _Vigor & Intuition_ |     _Vigor_      |
| **Moderate** | _Intuition & Reason_ |     _Intuition_     |     **All**      |
| **Major**    |       _Reason_       |       **All**       | _Vigor & Reason_ |



# Resting

To rest, either test [Resources](/skill-list#resources) if you are in a settlement, or test [Wilderness](/skill-list#wilderness) if are beyond the borders of civilization.

Anyone resting with you may also test the appropriate [Skill](/character#skills). Everyone, who has chosen the same skill and attribute, [tests as a group](/skill-tests#group-tests). If you are resting in a town, you will most likely get bonus dice for your rest roll (see [Supply Rating](/supply-rating)).

You may use [Assets](/assets) as usual, especially rations.

The effort you achieve during the rest test is the number of actions you have available for this rest before your shelter is exposed, before your allocated supplies run out and your rest ends.  
You may share actions with anyone else you are resting with as you please.

When you attempt a skill test while resting, you must spend actions equal to the test's difficultly to attempt it. If you do not have enough actions, you cannot attempt it.

You may end a rest at any point. Any unspent actions you have at the end of a rest are lost.

While resting, you have access to some special skill tests.


## Recovering

You may mend conditions afflicting you or someone resting with you.

You can mitigate major conditions to moderate conditions, moderate conditions minor conditions, and you can remove minor conditions. You can only mitigate a condition if you have an empty condition slot available for the mitigated condition.

To mend a minor condition is a difficulty **1** test. To mitigate a moderate condition to a minor condition is a difficulty **2** test. To mitigate a major condition to a moderate condition is a difficulty **3** test.

Mending one of your own conditions increases the difficulty of the test by **1.**

If you are not afflicted by any conditions, you may spend actions to gain a `Well Rested` enduring [Boon](/conflict#boons). This boon lasts across scenes, until it vanishes, or until you rest again, whichever happens first.

| `WELL RESTED` BOON RATING | ACTIONS REQUIRED |
|:-------------------------:|:----------------:|
|           **1**           |        1         |
|           **2**           |        3         |
|           **3**           |        6         |
|           **4**           |        10        |
|           **5**           |        15        |
|          **...**          |       ...        |


## Crafting

You may create new asset and improve assets you already own by testing Craft.

To create an asset with quality raring **1** is a test difficulty **1** test.

After being created, assets can only be improved by **1** rating at a time. To improve a asset from a quality rating of **2** to a quality rating of **3,** is a difficulty **3** test.

Improving an asset with rating **0** (an asset which broke after being used) grants **1** extra die to the test.


## Weather-Watching

While resting, you attempt a difficulty **1** Wilderness Intuition test to ask the GM how the weather trait will change in the near future.

You may also influence the weather by creating or changing a trait on the game by testing Wilderness with Intuition. Choose a rating for the trait you would like to create (if there is already a weather trait with equal or greater rating, you must instead change the existing trait; the difficulty is the current trait's rating).

If you've rolled more successes than the chosen rating, the game gets the weather trait of your choosing.

If you've rolled fewer successes or tied but still achieved at least **1** effort, increase or reduce the rating of the current weather trait by **1.** Otherwise, unfortunately, nature does is it pleases.



# Resting in the Wilderness

During a rest in the wilderness, you have access to some additional, special skill tests.


## Foraging

You may forage in the wild by testing Wilderness. Choose a rating for the Boon you would like to create by foraging.

If you've rolled more successes than the chosen rating or tied, you create an enduring `Provisions` Boon with the chosen rating. It vanishes at the end of the rest.

If you've rolled fewer successes but achieved at least **1** effort, you gain an enduring `Provisions` Boon with rating **1.**. Otherwise, unfortunately, you gain nothing.



# Resting in Settlements

During a rest in a settlement, you have access to some additional, special skill tests.


## Buying

You may buy assets in settlements by testing Resources. Choose a quality rating for the asset you would like to buy (Not all quality rating may be available everywhere, often quality rating above a town's [supply rating](/supply-rating) cannot be found).

If you've rolled more successes than the chosen quality rating, you gain the asset with the chosen quality rating.

If you've rolled fewer successes or tied but achieved at least **1** effort, you gain an asset with rating **1.** Otherwise, unfortunately, you gain nothing.


## Selling

You may sell assets you own by testing Resources. Choose an asset to sell and discard any success exceeding the asset's quality rating. The remaining result is the offer you get in your current rest location. You may accept that offer or decline it. Either way the actions to attempt selling this asset are spent. If you accept, you gain a `Currency` asset for Resources of the local currency with rating equal to the successes you've rolled.


## Working

You may spend your time working in the settlement. Choose a skill, and a difficulty for your work and spend actions accordingly (Not all work may be available everywhere).

Test the chosen skill against the difficulty. If you succeed, you gain a `Currency` asset for Resources of the local currency with rating equal to the chosen difficulty.

If you fail to succeed but achieved at least **1** effort, you gain a `Currency` asset with rating **1.** otherwise, unfortunately, you gain nothing.


## Research

You may spend your time among scrolls and tomes to learn more about a specific subject and its traits. Name the place, creature, or person you would like to know more about and test Resources with Reason. If you already know of a detrimental trait from the subject you are studying, you may invoke it for this test.

For your chosen subject, treat the outcome of your roll as if it were a trait with rating equal to the successes you rolled for the purposes of discovering traits (see [Discovering traits](/character#discovering-traits)).

If you rolled more successes than the subject's highest rated secret, you also learn that you know everything there is to know about your subject.

A research roll may result in no new information if you do not roll enough successes.
