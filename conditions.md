# Conditions

Conditions are temporary, negative, but unavoidable consequences of your daring adventures. They are always negative and will get in your way or even help the blackguards who cross your way until you get rid of them.

There are three different types of Conditions (as listed below). When the rules call for an *appropriate Condition,* they reference the different types of Conditions, as not all Conditions will hinder you on every test.

During an uncontested test, if you have an appropriate Condition with rating higher than the test's obstacle, treat the obstacle as if it were the rating of your appropriate Condition with the highest rating.

During Contests and Conflicts, your opponents will use your Conditions to their advantage. For your opponents, your Conditions work like Preparations (though using them does not degrade the Condition's rating), so they may treat any roll they've made for an action that takes advantage of your Condition as at least as many successes as the Condition's rating. You may use your opponents' Conditions in the same way as your opponent's can use yours.

You can reduce the rating of your Conditions by tending to them (see [Recovering](#recovering) on how to reduce the rating of your Conditions).


# Condition Slots

You have **6** slots for three kinds of different Conditions available. When you receive a new Condition, fill any available, empty slot with rating of at least that Condition's rating. A Condition in a slot always has the slot's rating.

Any of the three different Condition types -- physical, mental, and worldly -- fit into any of your available slots.

When a Condition's rating changes, move it to the according slot, given you have an according, empty slot. When a Condition's rating is reduced to **0** or less, it vanishes.

Should you receive a Condition but do not have any slot to note a Condition of that rating, increase that Conditions rating by **1** and try again until you find a slot with rating of at least that Condition's rating. If you cannot find any empty space to note your Condition, either because the Conditions rating is too high or because you have no more space for more Conditions, you are in deep trouble.

- During Conflicts, you must take a new detrimental Trait to absorb any remaining stress, and you are removed from the Conflict.
- Outside of Conflicts, your fate is even worse. Whatever has been gnawing at you, finally overwhelms you. Be it feverish wounds, madness, or social ostracization, and you must retire your character.

You have the following three types of slots for Conditions.

## Minor Conditions (Rating 1)

You have **3** slots available for minor Conditions.

These are minor inconveniences. Superficial cuts, bruised egos, a revolting appearance after days of adventuring, and similar troubles that arise with living an interesting life are minor Conditions. Nothing that cannot heal or mend with even just a little resting.

An uncontested test's difficulty is almost always at least **1,** these kinds of Conditions are more of a nuisance than a hindrance (unless they begin to pile up and fill your Condition slots).

## Moderate Conditions (Rating 2)

You have **2** slots available for moderate Conditions.

These are moderate setbacks. Flesh wounds, enduring exhaustion, nightmare-inducing disturbances, being accused of a crime, and similar troubles are moderate Conditions.


## Major Conditions (Rating 3)

You have **1** slot available for a major Condition.

These are grievous injuries which threaten to fester and prematurely end your journey should they not get immediate attention. Stab wounds to the gut, feverish sickness, debilitating delusions, complete ostracization, and similar threats to your character's life are major Conditions.


# Types of Conditions

There are three types of Conditions: physical, mental, and worldly.

## Physical Conditions

This type of Condition encompasses all types of physical trauma, bodily injury and muscle weariness. A cut from a blade is a physical Condition, so is exhaustion from excessive travelling, and so are sickness and poisoning.

Physical Conditions always will hinder you on Fight, Maneuver, Wilderness, and Craft tests.

Major physical Conditions also hinder you on Influence tests.

Physical Conditions never hinder you on Resource tests.

While resting, you can mend physical Conditions with Craft tests, though not all ratings can be mended by all [Approaches.](Approaches)

- Minor physical Conditions can be mended by Craft with any Approach.
- Moderate physical Conditions can be mended by Craft with Intuition and Reason but not by Vigor.
- Major physical Conditions can only be mended by Craft with Reason.


|                |  Hinders   |     |   Vigor    |    Intuition     | Reason |
|----------------|:----------:|-----|:----------:|:----------------:|:------:|
| **Influence**  | Only Major |     |     -      |        -         |   -    |
| **Fight**      |    All     |     |     -      |        -         |   -    |
| **Maneuver**   |    All     |     |     -      |        -         |   -    |
| **Wilderness** |    All     |     |     -      |        -         |   -    |

| **Resources**  |     -      |     |     -      |        -         |   -    |


## Mental Conditions

This type of Condition encompasses all types of mental trauma, spiritual injury and weariness of the mind. A biting insult to your character is a physical Condition, so is exhaustion from excessive research, and so are fear and confusion.

Mental Conditions always will hinder you on Influence, Maneuver, and Fight tests.

Major mental Conditions hinder you on all tests. You are never truly safe from your fears.

While resting, you can mend mental Conditions with Influence tests, though not all ratings can be mended with all Approaches.

- Minor mental Conditions can be mended by Influence with any Approach.
- Moderate mental Conditions can be mended by Influence with Vigor and Intuition but not by Reason.
- Major mental Conditions can only be mended by Influence with Intuition.


|                |  Hinders   |     |      Vigor       | Intuition |   Reason   |
|----------------|:----------:|-----|:----------------:|:---------:|:----------:|
| **Influence**  |    All     |     | Minor & Moderate |    All    | Only Minor |
| **Fight**      |    All     |     |        -         |     -     |     -      |
| **Maneuver**   |    All     |     |        -         |     -     |     -      |
| **Wilderness** | Only Major |     |        -         |     -     |     -      |
| **Craft**      | Only Major |     |        -         |     -     |     -      |
| **Resources**  | Only Major |     |        -         |     -     |     -      |


## Worldly Conditions

This type of Condition encompasses all types of societal rejection, representational injury and emptiness of the purse. The result of a successful slander campaign is a worldly Condition, so is reclusion (willing or otherwise) from larger society, and so are debts and being covered in muck.

Worldly Conditions always will hinder you on Influence, Craft, and Resource tests.

Major worldly Conditions also hinder you on Wilderness tests.

Worldly Conditions never hinder you on Fight or Maneuver tests.

While resting in a settlement, you can mend worldly Conditions with Resource tests, though not all ratings can be mended with all Approaches.

- Minor worldly Conditions can be mended by Resources with any Approach.
- Moderate worldly Conditions can be mended by Resources with Vigor and Reason but not by Intuition.
- Major worldly Conditions can only be mended by Resources with Vigor.


|                |  Hinders   |     | Vigor | Intuition  |      Reason      |
|----------------|:----------:|-----|:-----:|:----------:|:----------------:|

# Resting

To rest, either test [Resources](/skill-list#resources) if you aim to rest in a settlement, or test [Wilderness](/skill-list#wilderness) if you aim to rest beyond the borders of civilization.

Anyone resting with you may also test the appropriate [Skill](/skill-list). If you are resting in a town, you will most likely get bonus dice for your rest roll (see [Settlements](Settlements)).

You may use [Preparations](Preparations) as usual, especially rations.

Count the number of successes; these are the number of actions you have available for this rest before you run out. Each participant may share their successes with anyone else as they please.

If you attempt a Skill test during a rest, you must spend actions equal to the difficulty of the test to attempt it. If you do not have enough actions, you may not attempt it.

If you have no Conditions, you may spend actions to gain a `Well Rested` enduring Boon (see below how many actions are required for a Boon of each rating).

| **`Well Rested` Boon Rating** | **Actions Required** |
|:-----------------------------:|:--------------------:|
|               1               |          1           |
|               2               |          3           |
|               3               |          6           |

Any unspent actions you have at the end of a rest are lost.

During any rest, you have access to some special Skill tests.

### Crafting

You may create new Preparations and improve Preparations you already own by testing Craft.

To create a Preparation, you must roll **1** success. The resulting Preparation will have a quality rating of **1.**

After being created, Preparations can only be improved by **1** rating at a time. To improve a Preparation from a quality rating of **2** to a quality rating of **3,** you must roll **3** successes etc.

Improving a Preparation with rating **0** (a Preparation that has fully degraded after being used) grants **1** extra die to the test.

### Recovering

You may mend Conditions afflicting you or someone resting with you. You can only remove minor Conditions. Major Conditions can only be mitigated to moderate and moderate Conditions can only be mitigated to minor. You can only mitigate a Condition if you have an empty Condition slot available for the mitigated Condition.

To mend a minor Condition, you must roll **1** success. To mitigate a moderate Condition to a minor Condition, you must roll **2** successes. To mitigate a major Condition to a moderate Condition, you must roll **3** successes.

Mending one of your own Conditions increases the difficulty of the test by **1.**

### Predicting the Weather

You may predict the weather by creating or changing a Trait on the game by testing Wilderness with Intuition. Choose a rating for the Trait you would like to create (if there is already a weather Trait with equal or greater rating, you must instead change the existing Trait; the difficulty is the current Trait's rating).

If you've rolled more successes than the chosen rating, the game gets the weather Trait of your choosing.

If you've rolled fewer successes or tied but still rolled at least **1** success, increase or reduce the rating of the current weather Trait by equal to half your successes (rounded down with a minimum of **1**). Otherwise, unfortunately, you gain nothing.


# Resting in the Wilderness

During a rest in the wilderness, you have access to some additional, special skill test:


## Foraging

You may forage in the wild by testing Wilderness. Choose a rating for the Boon you would like to create by foraging.

If you've rolled more successes than the chosen rating or tied, you create an enduring `Provisions` Boon with the chosen rating. It vanishes at the end of the rest.

If you've rolled fewer successes but still rolled at least **1** success, you gain an enduring `Provisions` Boon with rating equal to half your successes (rounded down with a minimum of **1**). Otherwise, unfortunately, you gain nothing.


# Resting in Settlements

During a rest in a settlement, you have access to some additional, special skill test:


## Buying

You may buy Preparations in settlements by testing Resources. Choose a quality rating for the Preparation you would like to buy (Not all quality rating may be available everywhere, often quality rating above a town's [supply rating](Settlements#supply-rating) cannot be found).

If you've rolled more successes than the chosen quality rating, you gain the Preparation with the chosen quality rating.

If you've rolled fewer successes or tied but still rolled at least **1** success, you gain a Preparation with rating equal to half your successes (rounded down with a minimum of **1**). Otherwise, unfortunately, you gain nothing.


## Selling

You may sell Preparations you own by testing Resources. Choose a Preparation to sell and discard any success exceeding the Preparation's quality rating. The remaining result is the offer you get in your current rest location. You may accept that offer or decline it. Either way the actions to attempt selling this Preparation are spent. If you accept, you gain a Currency Preparation for Resources of the local currency with rating equal to the successes you've rolled.


## Working

You may spend your time working in the settlement. Choose a skill, and a difficulty for your work and spend actions accordingly (Not all work may be available everywhere).

Test the chosen skill against the difficulty. If you succeed, you gain a Currency Preparation for Resources of the local currency with rating equal to the chosen difficulty.

If you fail to succeed but still rolled at least **1** success, you gain a Currency Preparation with rating equal to half your successes (rounded down with a minimum of **1**). otherwise, unfortunately, you gain nothing.


## Research

You may spend your time among scrolls and tomes to learn more about a specific subject and its Traits. Name the place, creature, or person you would like to know more about and test Resources with Reason. If you already know of a detrimental Trait from the subject you are studying, you may invoke it for this test.

For your chosen subject, treat the outcome of your roll as if it were a Trait with rating equal to the successes you rolled for the purposes of discovering Traits (see [Discovering Traits](Traits#discovering-traits)).

If you rolled more successes than the subject's highest rated secret, you also learn that you know everything there is to know about your subject.

A research roll may result in no new information if you do not roll enough successes.


## Supply Rating

There are few things nicer than arriving in town after a long journey through the countryside, a hot bath tub and a nice feathery bed waiting for you. Though these nice luxuries, of course, did not fall from the sky.

As a general rule of thumb, the richer a town and the better its infrastructure, nicer it is to stay there. This rule of thumb is abstracted into a number that is called the supply rating of a settlement. When a character rests in a town, they may add its supply rating as dice to their roll.

**Eyeballing It:** If you simply need a quick number without much of the details: most towns in villages have a simple supply rating of **1.** Harbor towns and cities have a supply rating of **2,** and magnificently rich and capitols a supply rating of **3.**

Extremely lush forests or oases may also be given a supply rating when resting with [Wilderness](Skills#wilderness).

Thoughm RPG Thingy has a system for building towns and their surroundings from the ground up to determine their supply rating using [Preparations](Preparations) to abstract structures.

> Why would I want to put effort into calculating the supply rating of a town when I can simply assign a number and be done with it?
>
> In longer running campaigns, towns and cities will sometimes take on the role of characters. Mostly commonly that role will be Home.
>
> Home can be improved but Home can also be destroyed. Surely the mill being burned down by bandits will have some consequences for the town and its wealth. As GMs, we often flesh out these consequences with narrative weight. This system aims to also offer a tool to flesh them out even more with reasonable mechanical weight by making use of the Preparation system.

### Support Ratings

According to the Masterwork rule, Preparations with rating **3** or higher to not degrade for simple tests with only obstacle **1.** As Preparations can also structures, this has helpful implications for building a coherent and interconnected world. This **1** a structure Preparation can support is called its support rating.

The support rating of a structure Preparations is the highest obstacle of test it can be used for without degrading.

> A river parts the forest in two. Crossing it is no trivial task. The obstacle to cross it is **1.** A character could build a simple bridge across to cross. A bridge Preparation with rating **1** will help one character cross the river before collapsing (the river can still be crossed by succeeding on the obstacle **1** test without the help of the bridge). A bridge Preparation with rating **2** will help two characters cross the river but a bridge Preparation with rating **3** or higher does not degrade when used, as the obstacle against which it is used is only **1.**
>
> The bridge has a quality rating of **3** and a support rating of **1.**
>
> (Note that the bridge will still degrade by obstacles higher than its support rating, for example a ox and cart crossing the river, which would be a obstacle **2** test)

### Calculating Supply Rating

Settlements are, almost by definition, where multiple structures with a support rating of at least **1** accumulate.

> Next to the bridge with a support rating of **1,** a little town has formed around a magnificent mill Preparation with quality rating **5,** so its support rating is **2.**

A settlement's supply rating based on the surrounding Preparations and their support ratings is half of the sum of all relevant support ratings (rounded down).

> The bridge and mill around the town have a combined support rating of **3,** so the supply rating of the town is **1.** When characters rest in the town, they add an extra die to their rest roll.
>
> Should the existing Preparations be improved and/or new supporting structures be built around the town, its supply rating would improve. Should the existing Preparations degrade or be destroyed, its supply rating would decrease.

### Leisure Structures

Calculating supply rating already is a very handy tool to give characters to the towns and cities characters will visit. In some cases, though, they demand even more detail. For these cases, you can deploy leisture structures, who are always strongly associated with either a specific [Approach](Approach) or Condition type. They contribute their support rating to the settlement as normal, but also add dice equal tot heir support rating to recovery rolls made either with the corresponding Approach or for the corresponding Condition type.

Leisure structures might also allow for Skills to be used for the recovery roll than normal.

Per recovery roll, only **1** leisure structure may contribute additional dice.

Some examples for leisure structures are:

- A coliseum, which would be associated with Vigor and allow recovery rolls with Fight or Maneuver. Participating in the coliseum for a thrilling display of martial prowess, simply enjoying the show, or training on the sparring grounds will add dice equal to its the coliseum's support rating to all recovery tests made with Vigor.
- A palace garden, which would be associated with Intuition and allow recovery rolls with Resources or Wilderness. Going for a serene stroll through the water gardens, washing the dirt off bruised flesh, or watching a reenactment will add dice equal to the palace garden's support rating to all recovery tests made with Intuition.
- An academy, which would be associated with Reason and allow recovery rolls with Influence or Resources. Getting aid from a trained surgeon or banker, or spending some quiet time in the library will add dice equal to its the academy's support rating to all recovery tests made with Reason.
- A hospital, which would be associated with physical Conditions with Influence or Resources by acquiring medical care.
- A theater, which would be associated with mental Conditions and allow recovery rolls with Maneuver or Craft by processing your troubles in drama.
- A courthouse, which would be associated with worldly Conditions and allow recovery rolls with Influence or Fight by proving (or *proving)* your innocence.

> After a tumultuous journey, Maro arrives in the city of Artir, famed for its magnificent bathhouse. He could have made for a different town but he wanted to return to exactly here. After dealing with cutthroats and turncloaks at every corner, taking Conditions left and right, he is exhausted beyond words. When he finally steps into the steamy halls, bliss finally returns to him.
>
> Because of the city's respectable supply rating of **4,** Maro achieved enough successes to possibly rid himself of all his Conditions, if he manages to success on all recovery tests. Thankfully, he can add the bathhouse's impressive support rating of **3** (its total quality rating is **7**) to his Intuition recovery rolls and emerges Condition-free, even with a `Well Rested` Boon to boot. Should fate befall him again like this, he is sure to return. And should something threaten the splendid city of Artir, Maro will rush to aid without hesitation, to protect the city and her wonderful bathhouse.
