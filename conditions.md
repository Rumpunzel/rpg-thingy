Conditions are temporary, negative, but unavoidable consequences of your daring adventures. They are always negative and will get in your way or even help the blackguards who cross your way until you get rid of them.

There are three different types of Conditions (as listed below). When the rules call for an *appropriate Condition,* they reference the different types of Conditions, as not all Conditions will hinder you on every test.

During an uncontested test, if you have an appropriate Condition with rating higher than the test's obstacle, treat the obstacle as if it were the rating of your appropriate Condition with the highest rating.

During Contests and Conflicts, your opponents will use your Conditions to their advantage. For your opponents, your Conditions work like Preparations (though using them does not degrade the Condition's rating), so they may treat any roll they've made for an action that takes advantage of your Condition as at least as many successes as the Condition's rating. You may use your opponents' Conditions in the same way as your opponent's can use yours.

You can reduce the rating of your Conditions by tending to them (see [Resting](Resting) on how to reduce the rating of your Conditions).


## Condition Slots

You have **6** slots for three kinds of different Conditions available. When you receive a new Condition, fill any available, empty slot with rating of at least that Condition's rating. A Condition in a slot always has the slot's rating.

Any of the three different Condition types -- physical, mental, and worldly -- fit into any of your available slots.

When a Condition's rating changes, move it to the according slot, given you have an according, empty slot. When a Condition's rating is reduced to **0** or less, it vanishes.

Should you receive a Condition but do not have any slot to note a Condition of that rating, increase that Conditions rating by **1** and try again until you find a slot with rating of at least that Condition's rating. If you cannot find any empty space to note your Condition, either because the Conditions rating is too high or because you have no more space for more Conditions, you are in deep trouble.

- During Conflicts, you must take a new detrimental Trait to absorb any remaining stress, and you are removed from the Conflict.
- Outside of Conflicts, your fate is even worse. Whatever has been gnawing at you, finally overwhelms you. Be it feverish wounds, madness, or social ostracization, and you must retire your character.

You have the following three types of slots for Conditions.

### Minor Conditions (Rating 1)

You have **3** slots available for minor Conditions.

These are minor inconveniences. Superficial cuts, bruised egos, a revolting appearance after days of adventuring, and similar troubles that arise with living an interesting life are minor Conditions. Nothing that cannot heal or mend with even just a little resting.

An uncontested test's difficulty is almost always at least **1,** these kinds of Conditions are more of a nuisance than a hindrance (unless they begin to pile up and fill your Condition slots).

### Moderate Conditions (Rating 2)

You have **2** slots available for moderate Conditions.

These are moderate setbacks. Flesh wounds, enduring exhaustion, nightmare-inducing disturbances, being accused of a crime, and similar troubles are moderate Conditions.


### Major Conditions (Rating 3)

You have **1** slot available for a major Condition.

These are grievous injuries which threaten to fester and prematurely end your journey should they not get immediate attention. Stab wounds to the gut, feverish sickness, debilitating delusions, complete ostracization, and similar threats to your character's life are major Conditions.


## Types of Conditions

There are three types of Conditions: physical, mental, and worldly.

### Physical Conditions

This type of Condition encompasses all types of physical trauma, bodily injury and muscle weariness. A cut from a blade is a physical Condition, so is exhaustion from excessive travelling, and so are sickness and poisoning.

Physical Conditions always will hinder you on Fight, Maneuver, Wilderness, and Craft tests.

Major physical Conditions also hinder you on Influence tests.

Physical Conditions never hinder you on Resource tests.

While resting, you can mend physical Conditions with Craft tests, though not all ratings can be mended by all [Approaches.](Approaches)

- Minor physical Conditions can be mended by Craft with any Approach.
- Moderate physical Conditions can be mended by Craft with Intuition and Reason but not by Vigor.
- Major physical Conditions can only be mended by Craft with Reason.

| **Resources**  |     -      |     |     -      |        -         |   -    |


### Mental Conditions

This type of Condition encompasses all types of mental trauma, spiritual injury and weariness of the mind. A biting insult to your character is a physical Condition, so is exhaustion from excessive research, and so are fear and confusion.

Mental Conditions always will hinder you on Influence, Maneuver, and Fight tests.

Major mental Conditions hinder you on all tests. You are never truly safe from your fears.

While resting, you can mend mental Conditions with Influence tests, though not all ratings can be mended with all Approaches.

- Minor mental Conditions can be mended by Influence with any Approach.
- Moderate mental Conditions can be mended by Influence with Vigor and Intuition but not by Reason.
- Major mental Conditions can only be mended by Influence with Intuition.

|----------------|:----------:|-----|:----------------:|:---------:|:----------:|
| **Influence**  |    All     |     | Minor & Moderate |    All    | Only Minor |
| **Fight**      |    All     |     |        -         |     -     |     -      |
| **Maneuver**   |    All     |     |        -         |     -     |     -      |
| **Wilderness** | Only Major |     |        -         |     -     |     -      |
| **Craft**      | Only Major |     |        -         |     -     |     -      |
| **Resources**  | Only Major |     |        -         |     -     |     -      |


### Worldly Conditions

This type of Condition encompasses all types of societal rejection, representational injury and emptiness of the purse. The result of a successful slander campaign is a worldly Condition, so is reclusion (willing or otherwise) from larger society, and so are debts and being covered in muck.

Worldly Conditions always will hinder you on Influence, Craft, and Resource tests.

Major worldly Conditions also hinder you on Wilderness tests.

Worldly Conditions never hinder you on Fight or Maneuver tests.

While resting in a settlement, you can mend worldly Conditions with Resource tests, though not all ratings can be mended with all Approaches.

- Minor worldly Conditions can be mended by Resources with any Approach.
- Moderate worldly Conditions can be mended by Resources with Vigor and Reason but not by Intuition.
- Major worldly Conditions can only be mended by Resources with Vigor.
