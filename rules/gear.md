# Gear

Gear [Assets](/assets) are more specific versions of general assets. They work just like normal assets but have additional properties. These properties are only for their corresponding skill [conflicts](conflicts), only when the asset is used on a skill test. An asset's properties can only be used as long as it has a quality rating of at least **1.**

Some assets may be only specifically be used to attack or defend. If they are used to attack or defend but weren't meant to do so, it is treated as an off-label use and its rating is considered to be **1** (or its masterpiece rating, if the asset is a masterpiece) for that test.  

Gear assets also list the specific resource required to both craft and improve them.  
Some gear assets require another gear asset of at least masterpiece quality to be created. The masterpiece assets consumed by the process; the corresponding rating for the new asset is the rating of the consumed asset's masterpiece trait.
