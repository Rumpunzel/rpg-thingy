# Boons & Banes

Sometimes during a scene or [conflict](conflicts) you want to help yourself or an ally, or hinder an opponent. In that case, you may create a Boon to aid or a Bane to hinder. In conflicts, you may to so during [Positioning](/rules/conflicts.md#positioning) and hence, also during the conflict like any other Positioning.

When you test a skill to create a Boon or Bane, the number of successes (or excess successes if someone defends against your attempt) determines the Boon's/Bane's rating.

You may also turn excess successes after you have succeeded on a test into a Boon on yourself or, if you succeeded in a contest, into a Bane on your opponent by spending up to **1** Favour for each excess success to create a Boon/Bane with rating equal to the amount of Favour spent this way.

When a Boon or a Bane is created, its creator associates it either with the [Approach,](Approaches) or the [Skill](Skills) they used to create it. If the Bane or Boon is created during a conflict, its creator may choose attacking or defending instead of an Approach or a Skill.

- If an Approach was chosen, the Boon or Bane may only be used with the associated Approach but any skill.
- If a skill was chosen, the Boon or Bane may only be used with the associated skill but any Approach.
- If attacking was chosen, the Boon or Bane may be used to attack during the conflict with any Approach and any skill but not to defend.
- If defending was chosen, the Boon or Bane may be used to defend during the conflict with any Approach and any skill but not to attack.
- If a Boon or Bane is used with a different action, Approach or skill than intended, its rating is halfed (rounded down).

Boons & Banes only last for the context they were created in. In most cases that means for the duration of the conflict or for the duration of the scene.


## Boons

A Boon may be used on any roll where it would make sense that it would help you. When you use a Boon, add dice equal to the Boon's rating to your roll. Though, after you do, the Boon is used up and vanishes.

If you have multiple Boons which might fit, you have to choose only one of them.

Boons with extraordinary high ratings may let you add a number of dice (as shown below) to your roll without using up the Boon and without it vanishing.

|                      **Boon Rating**                      |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  | 10  |
|:---------------------------------------------------------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Dice that can be added<br/>without the Boon vanishing** |  -  |  -  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  2  |  3  |  3  |  4  |  4  |

> Cyrene wants to hide and sneak behind enemy lines. The camp is well guarded; someone is expecting her. The GM sets the obstacle to sneak into the camp at **2.** Cyrene tests Maneuver with the Approach of Intuition as she steps from shadow to shadow and rolls a phenomenal **5** successes. Easily enough to succeed. She spends **1** Favour and turns the **3** excess successes into a Boon named `Hidden from Sight` with rating **3** on herself. She chooses to associate it with Intuition instead of Maneuver.
>
> In the enemy camp, she finds her target of her assassination mission: the loathsome merchant king Samson. Cyrene and the GM agree that they are more interested in the fallout of this event than the assassination itself, so murdering the merchant discretely and making it out unseen will be a resolved with a  single test with obstacle **3.**
>
> Cyrene's initial roll shows only **2** successes, but she may now invoke her Boon `Hidden from Sight` to gain **3** extra dice for her assassination attempt. The **3** extra dice turn her attempt into a success. The Boon has been used and vanishes and so does Cyrene into the night.


## Banes

Banes are temporary detrimental [traits](traits), though Banes, are one-use only. After a Bane increased the obstacle of a test or was used by an opponent to get extra dice, it vanishes.

If an opponent has multiple Banes which you might use to aid you, you have to choose only one of them.

A Bane is not itself one of your opponent's traits, so you may invoke both a Boon and a detrimental trait for additional dice.

If you are affected by a Bane, your opponent's may use it to add dice to their rolls during contests and conflicts. If you instead test against a static obstacle, it is always assumed that the GM compels your highest rated Bane.

Banes with extraordinary high ratings may let you add a number of dice (as shown below) to your roll without using up the Bane and without it vanishing.

|                      **Bane Rating**                      |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  | 10  |
|:---------------------------------------------------------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Dice that can be added<br/>without the Bane vanishing** |  -  |  -  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  2  |  3  |  3  |  4  |  4  |

> The caravan Maro is escorting is being ambushed. One of the bandits is covered in mean battle scars, so Maro decides to leverage his superior mobility before engaging him directly. He tries to create a Bane with Maneuver and Intuition on the bandit by throwing sand into his eyes, who fails to defend against the attempt. Maro rolls **2** excess successes and creates a Bane named `Sand in my Eyes!` with rating **2** on the bandit. He chooses to associate it with defending.
>
> Anyone attacking the bandit or defending against one of his attacks may now add **2** to their roll once, as either way, the Bane vanishes after it has been used.


## Enduring Boons & Banes

Sometimes either extremely powerful effects like magic or the GM for narrative reasons might create Boons or Banes that endure for longer but a moment.

An enduring Boon degrades by **1** rating when it is used to add half or more (rounded up) of its rating as dice to a roll (instead of vanishing like normal Boon would).

An enduring Bane degrades by **1** rating after its rating was added to an obstacle.

When an enduring Boon/Bane reaches a rating of **0,** it vanishes.

An enduring Boon/Bane only degrades whenever a normal Bane/Boon would degrade (so extremely high rated enduring Boons and Banes may last even longer).

Enduring Banes/Boons may exist beyond a single conflict/scene, if it makes narrative sense.

> Cyrene and Maro have sneaked into a sleeping dragon's hoard to recover a long-lost artifact. The GM makes it quite clear that any test they fail while searching for the artifact will draw the attention of the dragon, though, thankfully, the dragon is asleep and has an enduring Bane on it called `Caught in a Deep Slumber` with a rating of **3** and associated with Intuition.
>
> Maro starts climbing the hoard of gold with a Maneuver test but the dice forsake him, and he rolls no successes. He invokes the `Caught in a Deep Slumber` Bane for free and adds **3** extra dice to his roll, turning it into a success, though the `Caught in a Deep Slumber` Bane degrades to a rating of **2** as a result. The dragon turns in his sleep, one eye almost opens but Maro remains unnoticed. The two of them have some breathing room before the dragon wakes. For now.



# Setup

Establish a Goal for each side.

Form teams behind each Goal.

Determine the relevant [Skill](Skills) for the conflict. ([Fight](Skills#fight) for skirmishes; [Influence](Skills#influence) for debates; [Maneuver](Skills#maneuver) for chases; etc.)

Name a captain for each side. Most of the time the person who initiated the conflict and their target.


# Positioning

Each captain chooses an [Approach](Approaches). Their chosen Approach's rating is each team's base Morale.

Each participant now tests a Skill that is not the relevant Skill with an Approach of their choice.

- Each member of the initiating team adds each success they achieved to their team's base Morale.
- Each member of the defending teams does so as well, unless they chose an Approach, which would force them to defend perfectly against the initiating captain's Disposition, then only the team members who achieved at least as many successes as the initiating team's captain add their successes to their team's Morale.

The corresponding total is their team's Morale for this conflict.

Turn order for the conflict is determined by the captains' successes. The captain with the most successes and their team go first etc. When two or more captains are tied, the team goes first where it makes more sense in the narrative; or, the team with the highest total Morale.

- Then, each member of the initiating team chooses a benefit depending on their number of successes and the Skill they've tested.
- Then, each member of the defending teams does so as well, unless they chose an Approach, which would force them to defend perfectly against the initiating captain's Disposition, then only the team members who achieved at least as many successes as the initiating team's captain gain this benefit.

These benefits only last for this conflict.


## Benefits

- Create a trait on the scene with rating equal to your successes
- Create a Boon on yourself, the scene, or an ally with rating equal to your successes
- Create a Bane on a known opponent with rating equal to your successes

| Vigor                                                  | Intuition                                                                  | Reason                                                                                                       |
|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Add your successes to your team's Morale a second time | Add your successes to your captain's successes when determining turn order | Learn of **1** trait, Condition, Boon, Bane, or Preparation with rating equal to or less than your successes |


## Immediate conflicts

Sometimes the story demands some form of arbitration from the rules for a conflict that started in the narrative without the rolling of dice and which does not want to be delayed any further. In that case, skip the Positioning phase of the conflict.

Practically all immediate conflicts are assumed to be held between two participants. Turn order should emerge naturally from the narrative. Furthermore, immediate conflicts are assumed to fight until one side surrenders. There are no Morale or Benefits in immediate conflicts.


# The conflict

Resolve the conflict now in turn order.

During a team's turn they may act in whatever order they choose until each member has acted once.

Each member tests the relevant Skill against a target of their choice (provided they can do so). They may do so with any Approach they like.

If the defending participant achieved more successes, they inflict the difference to their attacker's Morale.

If the attacking participant achieved more successes, they inflict the difference as Stress to the defender.

They also inflict that difference to their opponent's Morale, unless their Disposition would have forced the defending participant to defend perfectly, then they inflict all their successes to their opponent's Morale.

When all members of a team have acted, continue with the next team in turn order.


## Group Tests during conflicts

Two or more participants may work and attack together during their turn. If they choose to do so, they must both test against the same target as a group (the defender gains an additional die for each attacker beyond the first). For each attacker, if the defending participant achieved more successes, they inflict the difference to their attackers' Morale. Then the attackers add together all their successes and, if they achieved more successes than the defender, resolve the effects for the defender (stress and Morale damage) as if it had been one, single attack.

A participant may choose to test against multiple opponents at once. In that case, the opponents defend as a group (though without giving the attacker additional dice). For each defender, if the attacking participant achieved fewer successes, the defender inflicts the difference to the attacker's Morale. Then the defenders add together all their successes and, if the attacker achieved more successes than the defenders, the attacker resolves the effects for the defenders (stress and Morale damage) as if it had been one, single attack (this option is obviously extremely dangerous).


## Positioning during conflicts

Instead of testing the relevant Skill, a participant may test any Skill against a target of their choice (provided they can do so). If they do, they may only inflict Stress OR reduce their opponent's Morale, not both.

Instead of testing the relevant Skill to inflict Stress on an opponent, a participant may test a Skill, as if Positioning, against a target of their choice (provided they can do so). If they do, instead of inflicting Stress and reducing their opponent's Morale, they achieve they effect they would during Positioning, though instead of counting all successes, count only those they have more than their opponent (unless they would have needed to defend perfectly and did not). Their opponent still damages their Morale as normal, if they defend successfully.


## Ending a conflict

When a team member surrenders or otherwise laves the conflict, their team loses **1** Morale.

When a team's captain surrenders or otherwise laves the conflict, their team loses Morale equal to the number of remaining team members.

Once all members of a team have surrendered or are otherwise no longer able to act, they lose the conflict and do not achieve their Goal.
Once a team's Morale has been reduced to **0,** the member who failed to succeed on the defense roll causing his team's Morale to fall to **0** may enter their Last Stand.

A team loses the conflict and does not achieve its goal if its Morale has been reduced to **0** and either of the following conditions is true:

- None of its members have entered their Last Stand.
- All its members, who have entered their Last Stand have perished.
- All their opponents have been defeated. (Meaning all teams lose the conflict)

When only one team with at least **1** Morale remains, they win the conflict and achieve their Goal.

Should all teams lose the conflict, it spells catastrophic disaster. Depending on the narrative, all teams might achieve their Goals or none at all. A battle might leave the countryside in ruins with neither party having achieved their objective; the plotting of two rival underground factions might drive them both to ruin as they assure their mutual destruction; a heated debate between the king and his advisor about succession rights might end in them finding understanding for each other, leaving their disputes behind, and deciding on a third solution. When in doubt, settle for a compromise without any winners.



# Stress

During their turn, a participant may choose to surrender, removing themself from the conflict. They can no longer influence the outcome but they are out of harm's way. When they do, they test the relevant Skill and reduce their own team's Morale by the number of successes they achieved.

When a participant suffers Stress, they must gain a [Condition](conditions) to absorb it. (E.g. if they were to suffer **2** Stress, they could either take a Condition with rating **2** or **3** to absorb it)

If a participant cannot fully absorb the Stress they suffer with a single Condition, they must immediately take a new or replace an old [trait](traits) with a rating equal to the remaining Stress to absorb it. The trait gains a name in accordance with the defeat they have suffered.

Then, the participant must choose between the following two options:

- They immediately surrender from the conflict.
- They enter their Last Stand.


# Last Stand

A participant's Last Stand represents one last chance to still achieve their team's Goal.

They still stand strong even against the most desperate of odds.

The participant can still act normally in the conflict, despite their grievous setbacks until they leave their Last Stand.

The participant's Approach they used to either attack or defend, which resulted in them suffering more Stress than they could handle or their team's Morale being reduced to **0,** becomes doomed. A doomed Approach cannot be used during a participant's Last Stand but the participant immediately gains Favour equal to the rating of their doomed Approaches to aid them in their Last Stand.

Resolve their actions as you normally would with the following exceptions:

- During their Last Stand, if any of their actions causes the Morale of an opposing team to fall to **0,** the participant gains to a new [Legacy](traits#legacies) with rating **1** or adds **1** to an existing, fitting Legacy for the Approach they've used for that winning action.
- When all opposing teams have lost the conflict, they leave their Last Stand, their Approaches are no longer doomed, and they live to see another day.
- If at the any point during a participant's Last Stand, they suffer any Stress, they perish. (Depending on the type of conflict, they either die in battle, are exiled forever, completely lose their mind, etc.)


# Static conflict




# Disposition

The three attributes do not only form the foundation of your character but of all other characters and creatures you will encounter on your adventures, sometimes even the environment itself.

The scoundrel, who ambushes you in the gloomy ally; the moonlit lord, who anticipates your every move; even passive obstacles such as a river's roaring current, they all have attributes just like you. When you create your characters, you choose one of two possible Dispositions you have against these foes, and edge you have. But just like you, everyone else also has a Disposition, so tread carefully.

Your Disposition may force your target to perfectly defend against you. Which means, during conflicts they may only defend themself but not their team's Morale when defending with an Approach against which your chosen Approach is positively dispositioned.

Your disposition represents a certain knack you have against the other approaches, a weakness you might exploit. But beware, for your enemies also have dispositions!

#### Disposition I

**Reason must defend perfectly against your Vigor:** You are a force too overwhelming, your attacks are too mighty, your speeches are too gripping, they cannot be faced with a cool demeanour for you leave no demeanour cool.

**Vigor must defend perfectly against your Intuition:** You change course too deftly, your attacks are a stunning barrage, your lies are too tricky a web to navigate, they cannot be faced head-on with brute force for you bend like grass in the wind.

**Intuition must defend perfectly against your Reason:** Your plans are too well thought out, your attacks are too precise, your rhetorical traps are too sophisticated, they cannot be weaseled out of for you have thought of everything.

#### Disposition II

**Intuition must defend perfectly against your Vigor:** You are a force too overwhelming, your attacks are too mighty, your speeches are too gripping, they cannot be faced with the cowardice of a weasel for you leave no place left to hide.

**Reason must defend perfectly against your Intuition:** You change course too deftly, your attacks are a stunning barrage, your lies are too tricky a web to navigate, they cannot be faced with a cool demeanour for they still think about your last move while your are crossing the finish line.

**Vigor must defend perfectly against your Reason:** Your plans are too well thought out, your attacks are too precise, your rhetorical traps are too sophisticated, they cannot be faced head-on with brute force for every careless step spells disaster.
