#  Feats

## Vigor

**Bull Charge:** When testing Maneuver with Vigor, everything but Vigor must defend perfectly against you.

## Intuition

**Forerunner:** During contests (not only Maneuver contests), ties also count as successes for you. During conflicts (not only Maneuver conflicts), you inflict **1** damage to your opponent's Morale on ties. These benefits do not work should your opponent also have this Talent.

**Untouchable Grace:** When you would gain physical Condition while defending with Intuition, you may rename it and gain it as a mental Condition instead.

**Slippery:** Opponents cannot create Banes with Maneuver against you.

## Reason

**Eagle Eye:** All Approaches but Reason must perfectly defend against your Maneuver with Reason.

**Practiced:** When you create Boons and Banes from excess successes from attacking or defending, increase its rating by **1.**



# Specializations

## Vigor

**Athlete:** When testing Maneuver with Vigor, you may choose which dice modifier to use for the roll.

**Body of Steel:** Reduce all physical stress you take by **1.**

## Intuition

**Opportunist:** When invoking an opponent's trait (not only for Maneuver tests), gain **1** additional die.

**Reversal of Fortune:** Once per conflict, may exchange rolls with a willing ally or an opponent rolling at the same time.

## Reason

**Superior Strategist:** When positioning for conflicts with Maneuver, double your successes.

**One Step Ahead:** Your Maneuver Preparations only degrade when you do not succeed on the test.
