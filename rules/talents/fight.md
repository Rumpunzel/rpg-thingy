#  Feats


## Vigor

**Juggernaut:** When defending with Fight and Vigor, each **6** counts as two successes.

**Reckless:** When creating a Boon with Vigor during a Fight conflict, you may make it enduring by gaining a `Reckless` Bane with rating equal to the created Boon's rating. The `Reckless` Bane does only hinder you from defending, not from attacking.

**Steadfast:** When defending with against multiple opponents, roll an additional die for each opponent attacking you.

## Intuition

**Riposte:** When successfully defending with Fight and Intuition, may also inflict Stress equal to the number of excess successes in addition to damaging Morale.

**Uncanny Dodge:** Once per Fight conflict, you may suffer a minor Condition instead of resolving a defense test.

## Reason

**Battle Tactician:** When Positioning for a Fight conflict, you may roll for Positioning twice and gain two different benefits.

**Shield Training:** When adding your shield Preparation's rating as dice to defense rolls, the shield's armor rating only degrades if you fail to defend.

**Armor Training:** You may use armor Preparations with their full quality rating for any Approach when defending with Fight.



# Specializations

## Vigor

**Berserker:** The `Angry` Condition and other mental conditions no longer hinder your attacks (not only during Fight conflicts). At the beginning of a Fight conflict, if you suffer from the `Angry` Condition, you may gain an enduring `Battle Rage` Boon with rating equal to the Condition's rating.

**Slayer:** When attacking with Vigor in a Fight conflict, inflict **1** additional stress for each **6** you rolled, even if your opponent defended successfully (this does not increase the damage to the opponent's Morale).

**Martial Artist (Defend):** Choose one of your traits representing your martial training (if you do not have such a trait, you cannot choose this Talent) and an Approach; you may treat the chosen trait as a Preparation with quality rating equal to its rating for defending with Fight and the chosen Approach (the trait does not degrade when used and using it does not cost Favour).

## Intuition

**Battle Master:** You may act twice during your turn in Fight conflicts.

**Dervish:** When attacking (not only during Fight conflicts), roll an additional die for each opponent defending against you (even if you would normally not gain any additional dice).

**Pack Tactics:** When attacking as a group with Intuition, your allies do not increase the difficulty and not add extra dice for your opponent.

## Reason

**Guardian:** When an ally defends against an attack (not only during Fight conflicts), you may force the attacker you attack you both and defend with your ally as a group (the attacker does not gain additional dice).

**Marksman:** When attacking with Fight and Reason, you may choose which dice to re-roll instead of re-rolling all at once.

**Martial Artist (Attack):** Choose one of your traits representing your martial training (if you do not have such a trait, you cannot choose this Talent) and an Approach; you may treat the chosen trait as a Preparation with quality rating equal to its rating for attacking with Fight and the chosen Approach (the trait does not degrade when used and using it does not cost Favour).
