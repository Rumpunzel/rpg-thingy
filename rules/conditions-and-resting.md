# Conditions

Conditions are temporary but unavoidable negative consequences of when you suffer [Stress](#stress) your daring adventures. They will get in your way and, with time, fester if not looked after. And worst of all, they will help the blackguards who cross your way until you get rid of them.

Conditions have a number associated with them called their [Severity](#condition-severities). A conditions severity increases as you gain stress during your adventures.

Uncontested test always have a minimum difficulty equal to the highest severity of your appropriate conditions. If an uncontested test already has a higher difficulty, your conditions do not increase it.

During contests, your opponents may use your conditions to their advantage. Your opponent's minimum effort when testing against you is equal to the highest severity of your appropriate conditions.  
You may use your opponents' conditions against them for minimum effort in the same way as your opponent's can use yours against you.



# Condition Types

You have **1** slot for each a physical, mental, and social condition. When the rules call for an _appropriate_ Condition, they reference the different types of conditions as not all conditions will hinder you on every test.

Your condition slots start of empty. Whenever you suffer stress of a certain type, mark the lowest available stress box in the slot of that type. If that slot had no stress boxes marked previously, name and add a condition into the slot (see [Stress](#stress)).


## Physical Conditions

These conditions encompass all types of physical trauma, bodily injury and weariness. A cut from a blade is a physical Condition, so is exhaustion from excessive travelling, and so are sickness and poisoning.

Physical conditions always will hinder you on Fight, Maneuver, Wilderness, and Craft tests. Wounds nor exhaustion get in the way of your concentration and coordination.

Physical conditions never hinder you on Influence and Resource tests.

While resting, you can mend physical conditions by testing Craft, though not all severities can be mended with all [Attributes](character#attributes).

- **Minor physical conditions can be mended with any attribute.**
- **Moderate physical conditions can be mended with Intuition and Reason.** Some sense for field dressing or at least attentive care are required for these kinds of wounds.
- **Major physical conditions can only be mended with Reason.** Practiced surgery is required to close these kinds of wounds.


## Mental Conditions

These conditions encompass all types of mental trauma, spiritual injury, and weariness of the mind. A biting insult to your character is a mental Condition, so is exhaustion from excessive research, and so are fear and confusion.

Mental conditions always will hinder you on Influence, Maneuver, and Fight tests. Your nerves always surface in the clutch moments, at the most importune times, and they always get in the way of your composure.

Major mental conditions hinder you on all tests. There is no running from your delusions and greatest fears.

While resting, you can mend mental conditions by testing Influence, though not all severities can be mended with all Approaches.

- **Minor mental conditions can be mended by Influence with any Approach.**
- **Moderate mental conditions can be mended by Influence with Vigor and Intuition but not by Reason.** Some sense of genuine compassion or at least a warming presence is required for these troubles.
- **Major mental conditions can only be mended by Influence with Intuition.** Heartfelt empathy is required to tackle these troubles.


## Social Conditions

These conditions encompass all types of debts, societal rejection, accusations and other injuries to your reputation. The result of a successful slander campaign is a social Condition, so is seclusion (willing or otherwise) from larger society, and so are debts, and being covered in muck.

Social conditions always will hinder you on Craft and Resource tests. Being cut off from the currents of society strains your access to all its marvels.

Major social conditions also hinder you on Influence and Craft tests. A horrendous reputation is an uphill battle wherever you might want to make yourself heard and also cuts off the artisan from their supplies.

Social conditions never hinder you on Fight, Maneuver, and Wilderness tests.

While resting in a settlement, you can mend social conditions with Resource tests, though not all severities can be mended with all Approaches.

- **Minor social conditions can be mended by Resources with any Approach.**
- **Moderate social conditions can be mended by Resources with Vigor and Reason but not by Intuition.** Fame, Wealth, rigorous bookkeeping, or a sound argument before a court are required to get out of these predicaments.
- **Major social conditions can only be mended by Resources with Vigor.** Nobility, a made name, or chests of gold are required to get out of these predicaments.



# Stress

Each of your condition slots has **6** stress boxes that you can mark to absorb stress you suffer. Each box has a corresponding number which denotes how much stress than box absorbs when you mark it. You have **3** boxes which may absorb **1** stress each, **2** boxes which may absorb up to **2** stress each, and **2** box which may absorb up to **3** stress.

Whenever you suffer stress, mark an empty box in the corresponding condition slot, noting that it absorbed that stress. Stress you suffer must be entirely absorbed by a single box, you may not distribute stress between boxes.

Should you not have an empty box to absorb stress you suffered, you are in deep trouble.
You may spend Favor equal to the stress you suffered to get a new trait with rating equal to the amount of Favor spent which absorbs the stress for you. Name the trait to describe the permanent injury you suffered and escaped by a hair's breadth.
Otherwise, whatever has been gnawing at you, finally overwhelms you. Be it blood loss, drowning, permanent imprisonment, succumbing to sickness, execution, madness, or complete social ostracism, and you must retire your character.


## Condition Severities

The condition in a condition slot has a severity of **1** (minor), **2** (moderate), or **3** (major) depending on the highest stress box marked in it.

You can reduce the severity of your conditions by tending to them (see [Recovering](#recovering)). When a Condition's severity changes to **0**, it vanishes.

### Minor Conditions (Severity 1)

A condition is minor if the highest marked stress box in its slot is **1.**

These conditions are minor inconveniences. Superficial cuts, bruised egos, a revolting appearance after days of adventuring, and similar troubles, that arise with living an interesting life, are minor conditions. Nothing that cannot heal or mend with even just a little resting.

As an uncontested test's difficulty is always at least **1** and most foes you will encounter will be armed, so these kinds of conditions are more nuisance than hindrance (unless they begin to pile up and fill your Condition slots).


### Moderate Conditions (Severity 2)

A condition is moderate if highest marked stress box in its slot is **2.**

These conditions are moderate setbacks. Flesh wounds, enduring exhaustion, nightmare-inducing disturbances, being accused of a crime, and similar troubles are moderate conditions.


### Major Conditions (Severity 3)

A condition is major if the **3** stress box is marked.

These conditions are grievous injuries which threaten to fester and prematurely end your journey should they not get immediate attention. Stab wounds to the gut, feverish sickness, debilitating delusions, complete ostrezitation, and similar threats to your character's life are major conditions.



# Conditions in Revue

- There are physical, mental, and social conditions.
- You have **1** slot each of the three condition types.
- Each slot has **3** boxes to absorb **1** stress, **2** boxes to absorb up to **2** stress, and **1** box to absorb up to **3** stress.
- A condition's severity is equal to the highest stress box marked in its slot.
- Tests you encounter will have a minimum difficulty equal to your highest appropriate condition.
- If a character cannot absorb stress, they meet their fate.
- Physical and mental conditions can be mended while resting.
- Social conditions can only be mended while resting in settlements.

### Appropriate conditions

The rules on when a Condition hinders you on which kind of test are supposed to be a solid foundation to operate on. As conditions are named after the circumstance they were inflicted, a Condition's name might suggest that it should be applicable in even broader circumstances.

Mental conditions are a prime example that might hinder you in almost any circumstance, even if the Condition is not major.
Or, for example, a social Condition marking you as a wanted for a gruesome murder might even hinder you on Wilderness tests as the tales of your misdeeds travelled across the land and no one you meet on the road is willing to help you, even getting in your way, and you must keep from the travelled road.

This table is meant as a guide, the table's judgement is the ultimate authority if a Condition will hinder you and, of course, you can almost always voluntarily hinder yourself with your own conditions if you find it appropriate.

|                | Physical Hinders | Mental Hinders | Social Hinders |
|----------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| **Influence**  |        -         |    **All**     |  _Only Major_  |
| **Fight**      |     **All**      |    **All**     |       -        |
| **Maneuver**   |     **All**      |    **All**     |       -        |
| **Wilderness** |     **All**      |  _Only Major_  |       -        |
| **Craft**      |     **All**      |  _Only Major_  |  _Only Major_  |
| **Resources**  |        -         |  _Only Major_  |    **All**     |

### Mending conditions

The three different types of conditions have restrictions with which skill and which attribute they can be mended.

[Leisure Structures](gm-tools/settlements#leisure-structures) can give you additional options to get rid of your conditions but on the road or without help, these are the only ways to get rid of conditions.

|              |  Physical Mended By  |  Mental Mended By   | Social Mended By |
|--------------|:--------------------:|:-------------------:|:----------------:|
| **Skill**    |      **Craft**       |    **Influence**    |  **Resources**   |
| **Minor**    |       **All**        |       **All**       |     **All**      |
| **Moderate** | _Intuition & Reason_ | _Vigor & Intuition_ | _Vigor & Reason_ |
| **Major**    |       _Reason_       |     _Intuition_     |     _Vigor_      |



# Resting

To rest, either test [Resources](/skill-list#resources) for [Downtime](#downtime) if you are in a settlement, or test [Wilderness](/skill-list#wilderness) to [Make Camp](#making-camp) if are beyond the borders of civilization.

Anyone resting with you may also test the appropriate [Skill](character#skills). Everyone, who has chosen the same skill and attribute, [tests as a group](/skill-tests#group-tests). If you are resting in a town, you will most likely get bonus dice for your rest roll (see [Supply Rating](/rules/gm-tools/settlements.md#supply-ratings)).

You may use [Assets](assets) as usual, especially rations.

You gain a number of [Materials](assets#materials) equal to the effort you achieve during the resting test. They symbolize the resources you have at your disposal and the time you have available for this rest before your shelter is exposed, before your allocated supplies run out and your rest ends.  
You may share materials with anyone else you are resting with as you please.

Depending on the attribute you tested with, the materials will be of a different type.

|               Vigor               |             Intuition             |                Reason                 |
|:---------------------------------:|:---------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------:|
| [Sturdy](assets#sturdy) materials | [Supple](assets#supple) materials | [Precious](assets#precious) materials |

When you attempt a skill test while resting, you must spend materials equal to the test's difficultly to attempt it. If you do not have enough materials, you cannot attempt it.  
Most tests may use any type of material but some tests such as [Crafting](assets#crafting-assets) require specific materials.

You may end a rest at any point. Any unspent materials you have at the end of a rest are lost.

While resting, you have access to a number of special skill tests.


## Crafting

You may create new asset and improve assets you already own as detailed in [Crafting Assets](assets#crafting-assets) in the chapter about assets.


## Recovering

You may mend physical and mental conditions afflicting you or someone resting with you.

You can mitigate a major condition to a moderate condition by succeeding on a difficulty **3** test. When you succeed, clear the **3** stress box in the condition's slot and rename the condition to reflect its mitigated severity.

You can mitigate a moderate condition to a minor condition by succeeding on a difficulty **2** test. When you succeed, clear both **2** stress boxes in the condition's slot and rename the condition to reflect its mitigated severity.

You can mend a minor condition by succeeding on a difficulty **1** test. When you succeed, clear all **1** stress box in the condition's slot and remove the condition from its slot.

Mending one of your own conditions increases the difficulty of the test by **1.**

If you all your condition slots are empty, you may spend materials to gain a `Well Rested` enduring [Boon](conflicts#boons). This boon lasts across scenes, until it vanishes, or until you rest again, whichever happens first.

| `Well Rested` Boon Rating | Materials Requires |
|:-------------------------:|:------------------:|
|           **1**           |         1          |
|           **2**           |         3          |
|           **3**           |         6          |
|           **4**           |         10         |
|           **5**           |         15         |
|          **...**          |        ...         |


## Weather-Watching

While resting, you may increase or decrease the rating of the current weather trait by **1,** or alter the name of the current weather trait (within reason).  
To do so, test Wilderness with Intuition. The difficulty for the test is the rating of the current weather trait. If you fail, the GM may increase or decrease the rating of the current weather trade or rename it to introduce a complication.

You may watch the weather any number of times per rest.



# Making Camp

While resting in the wilderness, you have access to some additional, special skill tests.


## Foraging

You may forage in the wild by testing Wilderness. Choose a difficulty for the foraging test.



# Downtime

While resting a settlement, you have access to some additional, special skill tests.


## Recovering in Settlements

While resting in a settlement, you may mend social conditions afflicting you or someone resting with you (just like you would physical or mental conditions).


## Buying

You may buy assets in settlements by testing Resources. Choose a quality rating for the asset you would like to buy. Not all quality rating may be available everywhere, often quality rating above a town's [Supply Rating](gm-tools/settlements#supply-ratings) cannot be found.

If you succeed, you gain the asset with the chosen quality rating. Otherwise, if you achieved at least **1** effort, you gain an asset with rating **1.**

| Quality Rating | Difficulty |
|:--------------:|:----------:|
|     **1**      |     1      |
|     **2**      |     3      |
|     **3**      |     5      |
|     **4**      |     7      |
|     **5**      |     9      |
|    **...**     |    ...     |


## Selling

You may sell an asset you own by testing Resources. Discard any success exceeding the asset's quality rating. The remaining result is the offer you get in your current rest location. You may accept that offer or decline it. Either way, the materials to attempt to sell the asset are spent.  
If you accept, you gain a `Currency` asset for Resources of the local currency with rating equal to the effort you achieved and lose the chosen asset.


## Working

You may spend your time working while resting in a settlement. Choose a skill and a difficulty for your work (not all type of work may be available everywhere).

If you succeed, you gain a `Currency` asset for Resources of the local currency with rating equal to the chosen difficulty. Otherwise, if you achieved at least **1** effort, you gain a `Currency` asset with rating **1.**


## Research

You may spend your time brawling in taverns, visiting shady meetings, or among scrolls and tomes to learn more about a specific subject and its traits. Name the place, creature, or person you would like to know more about and test Resources. For each of your subject's hidden traits you already know, add **1** additional dice to your roll.

You learn of your subject's highest rated, hidden trait you do not already know with rating equal to or less the effort you achieved on your test. If your effort is greater than the subject's highest rated hidden trait, you also learn that you know everything there is to know about your subject.  
A research roll may result in no new information if you do not achieve enough effort.

Depending on what subject you would like to research, a different attribute is required.
