A Trait is a factual description about what makes your character extraordinary with mechanical weight. He may have a nice beard but if he has the `Magnificient Beard` Trait, he has such a great beard, you may use it to your benefit and even to your detriment to gain [Favor](Favor).

A Trait has a rating, usually ranging from **1** to **3.**



## Using Traits to your Benefit

When you test a skill, you may spend **1** Favor to invoke one of your Traits to re-roll **1** of the dice of your roll. Per test, you may invoke a Trait a number of times up to the rating of the Trait. Per test, you may only invoke a single of your Traits per test. If you have multiple Traits which might fit, you have to choose only one of them.

Traits with extraordinary high ratings (normally this means rating **3**) may let you re-roll a number of dice (as shown below) for free without spending Favor.

| **Trait Rating** |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  | 10  |
|:----------------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|  **Free Dice**   |  -  |  -  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  2  |  3  |  3  |  4  |  4  |

So if you want to use a Trait with rating **3** to help you, you may re-roll **1** die for free and may spend up to **2** Favor to re-roll up to **2** more.



> Cyrene has the Trait `Drunkard` with a rating of **1.**
>
> During a drinking competition, she invokes it to re-roll **1** of her dice, which, in the end, gives her just the edge she needs to emerge victorious.



## Using Traits to your Detriment

There are many reasons to use one of your Traits to your detriment. It can lead to great roleplaying moments, it can let you communicate who your character and their flaws are, it can be simply for fun, and it can lead to you earning more Favor for later use.

You may use any of your Traits to your detriment, both against static obstacles and in Contests and Conflicts, as long as it makes sense that the Trait would in some way hinder you.

You may only use a Trait to either help or hinder you, not both.

### Against Static Obstacles

When you test with a skill against a static obstacle, you may add one of your Trait's rating to the obstacle, if it would make sense that said Trait would hinder you at what you are trying to achieve. This might increase the amount of Favor you will receive should you fail the test.

The GM may compel you to use one of your Traits to your detriment when it would be both appropriate and dramatic when testing against a static obstacle. You may decline the compel by spending Favor equal to the Trait's rating. If you accept, use the Trait to your detriment as you normally would.



> When Cyrene tries to balance across a raging river, her `Drunkard` Trait hinders her, and she adds **1** to the
> obstacle, which results in her falling into the water and gaining additional Favor instead of succeeding.

---

### During Contests & Conflicts

Alternatively, when you test with a skill in a Contest or Conflict, you may also use a fitting Trait to your detriment. Though, in most cases, your opponent will be the one to do so first.

In a Contest or Conflict, instead of increasing an obstacle, using a Trait to your detriment in this context, lets your opponent add your Trait's rating as dice to their roll.

When one of your Traits is used against you in a Contest of Conflict, you may spend **1** Favor to reduce the number of dice you give your opponent by **1.** You may do this a number of times equal to the Trait's rating until you no longer give your opponent any dice.



> During a kerfuffle at court, Cyrene tries to embarrass one of the guests she has met before (when he crossed her during a previous adventure). She only manages **1** success on her roll, though he manages none at all, he invokes Cyrene's `Drunkard` Trait against her to add **1** die to his roll. Cyrene may now spend **1** Favor to not give him that additional die, but she wants to see what will happen and decides against it.
>
> The obnoxious guest manages to roll a success on his additional die and turns the outcome into a tie, which he, as defender, wins. The court is now laughing at Cyrene, as he deflects her insults right back into her face. What a windbag. At least she received **1** Favor from her **1** success.



## Signaling

By taking a Trait, a player signals to the group that they are interested in that particular part of the story or their character. The higher the rating of your Trait, the more they want the Trait to come up in the game. Consider this when choosing your own Traits. Think about what you want to experience during the game and try to model your character's Traits after the goal.



> Maro has the Trait `Exiled Sellsword of Gantha` with a rating of **2.** By taking this Trait, he let the group know quite a bit about what he wanted to experience with his character. His character is a sellsword, so he will mostly likely want to invoke the Trait during fights. His character is also from a place called Gantha from which he has been exiled. By putting both of these aspects of his character into one Trait, he also signals that those two stories are somehow interconnected.
>
> He could have also split the Trait in two such as `Exile of Gantha` and `Famed Sellsword` and given them different ratings, had one aspect been more important to him than the other or if they had nothing or little to do with each other in the story.



## Traits as Knowledge & Experience

If you have a Trait, openly known Traits of places, creatures, or people connected to your area of expertise. You may ask the GM for this at any time, and you are invited to enrich the world with your descriptions of your character's experience any time you see fit.

Even if you don't have a fitting Trait, all superficial or incomplete knowledge, rough outlines big events is always available to you.

You may also spend Favor on a Trait representing your experience or familiarity to create a mechanical advantage for you (mostly in the form of revealing new Traits). The better your rating, the more detailed, obscure information you may create or discover.

Alternatively, you may spend **1** Favor on a Trait to gain a Preparation with rating **1** representing something you would always carry with you considering the experience that Trait represents.



> During their last adventure, Mare and Cyrene have crossed path with the robber king of Gantha and Maro got swept up in his character's past and now this robber king spells quite a bit of trouble. Though, as an `Exiled Sellsword of Gantha`, there is for sure something Maro knows about this robber king that might aid them in their struggle.

### Discovering Traits

Depending on the rating of your Trait, different kinds of information are available to you:

- **Rating 1:** All openly known Traits and the highest Approach (if applicable) of all places, creatures, or people connected to the Trait, as well as its best Skill (if applicable) and its Disposition (if applicable).
- **Rating 2:** In-depth knowledge of the most common subject areas; rough outlines of obscure facts; all secret Traits with a rating of **1** and the two highest Approaches (if applicable) of all places, creatures, or people connected to the Trait, as well as its two best Skills (if applicable) and its Disposition (if applicable).
- **Rating 3+:** Expert at the topic; solid knowledge of even obscure facts and occurrences; all secret Traits with a rating less than your Trait's rating and all Approaches (if applicable) of all places, creatures, or people connected to the Trait, as well as its three best Skills (if applicable) and its Disposition (if applicable).



> As Maro's Trait `Exiled Sellsword of Gantha` has a rating of **2,** he knows of the robber king's two highest Approaches are Reason and Intuition, as well as that both are higher than his.
>
> Fortunately, he also learns of the robber king's secret Trait `Only goes out at Night` which has a rating of **1.** It is not much but if he harbors such a secret, perhaps there is more hiding beneath to surface. Time to do some research (see [Research](Resting#research)).

### Creating Traits

Alternatively, you may also suggest a new Trait for a place, a creature, or a person connected to one of your own Traits. If the table agrees with your suggestion, you may spend Favor up to the rating of your own Trait and create the new Trait on the place, creature, or person with rating equal to the amount of Insight you spent.

It can also happen that the GM likes your suggestion so much that he adds the Trait (or a variation of it) on his volition, without you having to spend Favor and with the rating of their choosing.




## Legacies

Legacies are special and powerful Traits that are always positive.

The only way to gain Legacies is through surviving a [Last Stand](Conflict#last-stand) during a Conflict. Legacies are always associated with an [Approach](Approaches).

You may invoke a Legacy just like a Trait, though you may invoke both a Trait and a Legacy on the same roll. In addition, when you invoke a Legacy, you also add the associated Approach's dice modifier to that roll. This may allow you to use up to two different dice modifiers on the same roll.
