Each character has the three following different Approaches. Each Approach represents a different way forward in the narrative when it comes to confronting a problem. Each character has a numerical rating associated with each Approach. This rating determines how many dice that character will roll when they face a problem with that Approach.

Each Aspect also has a unique Dice Modifier that changes a few things about dice are rolled and a [Disposition](#Disposition) which gives you and edge when engaging someone else in a contest.

## Vigor

Vigor encompasses strength, both of body and mind; endurance; tenacity; ferocity; panache; and power of will.

It is the most direct approach. It's a matter of facing problems head-on, courageous, and with conviction always at your side. A matter of going all out to win it and to win big. As such, it is the Approach most closely linked to the control and harnessing of fiery emotions.

You approach a challenge with Vigor whenever you swing your mighty axe in a blinded rage, whenever you embolden your compatriots with a fiery speech, whenever you weave a heart-breaking tune on your lyre, or whenever remain calm even in the face of a terrifying acid-spewing monstrosity.

**Dice Modifier:** For every die whose face comes up as a 6, roll an additional die. If that additional die also comes up a 6, it explodes as well. Continue this process until you have rolled an additional die for each 6 you've rolled.




## Intuition

Intuition encompasses flexibility, both of body and mind; nimbleness; guile; reflexes; wit; cleverness; and empathy.

It is the most reactive approach. It's a matter of facing problems in the moment and with the element of surprise always on your side. A matter of tipping the scales in your favour by anticipating the future and going with the flow.

You approach a challenge with Intuition whenever you swirl your blade like a derwish, whenever you outfox your enemies with your silver tongue, whenever you know exactly the right thing to say in the face of defeat, whenever you escape disaster by a hair's breadth without breaking a sweat.

**Dice Modifier:** For every die whose face comes up as a 1, you roll it again. If that die comes up a 1 again, repeat this process. Continue this until there are no 1's left in your pool.




## Reason

Reason encompasses precision, both of body and mind; deftness; intellect; foresight; industriousness; and rigor.

It is the most thoughtful approach. It's a matter of facing problems on your own terms and with a contigency plan always by your side. A matter of knowing your enemies, their blindspots, and taking the time to masterfully exploit them.

You approach a challenge with Reason whenever you fell the rider approaching from the horizon with a single arrow, whenever you facilitate genuine understanding between warring parties, whenever doom misses you by a mile as you were expecting it, whenever you find yourself in a race with fate one step ahead.	

**Dice Modifier:** After the dice have been cast, you may ignore the result and roll all dice again.




## Disposition

These Approaches do not form the foundation of only your character. The scoundrel ambushes you in the gloomy ally, the moonlit lord anticipates your every move, even passive obstacles such as a river's current might roar with ferocity. When you create your character you have the choice between two different dispositions, a representation of how your characters engages with his surroundings.

Your Disposition may force your target to perfectly defend against you. Which means, during Conflicts they may only defend themself but not their team's Morale when defending with an Approach against which your chosen Approach is positively dispositioned.

Your disposition represents a certain knack you have against the other approaches, a weakness you might exploit. But beware, for your enemies also have dispositions!

#### Disposition I

**Reason must defend perfectly against your Vigor:** You are a force too overwhelming, your attacks are too mighty, your speeches are too gripping, they cannot be faced with a cool demeanour for you leave no demeanour cool.

**Vigor must defend perfectly against your Intuition:** You change course too deftly, your attacks are a stunning barrage, your lies are too tricky a web to navigate, they cannot be faced head-on with brute force for you bend like grass in the wind.

**Intuition must defend perfectly against your Reason:** Your plans are too well thought out, your attacks are too precise, your rhetorical traps are too sophisticated, they cannot be weaseled out of for you have thought of everything.

#### Disosition II

**Intuition must defend perfectly against your Vigor:** You are a force too overwhelming, your attacks are too mighty, your speeches are too gripping, they cannot be faced with the cowardice of a weasel for you leave no place left to hide.

**Reason must defend perfectly against your Intuition:** You change course too deftly, your attacks are a stunning barrage, your lies are too tricky a web to navigate, they cannot be faced with a cool demeanour for they still think about your last move while your are crossing the finish line.

**Vigor must defend perfectly against your Reason:** Your plans are too well thought out, your attacks are too precise, your rhetorical traps are too sophisticated, they cannot be faced head-on with brute force for every careless step spells disaster.
