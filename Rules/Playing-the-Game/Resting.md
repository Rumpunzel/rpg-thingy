To rest, either test [Resources](Skills#resources) if you aim to rest in a settlement, or test [Wilderness](Skills#wilderness) if you aim to rest beyond the borders of civilization.

Anyone resting with you may also test the appropriate [Skill](Skills). If you are resting in a town, you will most likely get bonus dice for your rest roll (see [Settlements](Settlements)).

You may use [Preparations](Preparations) as usual, especially rations.

Count the number of successes; these are the number of actions you have available for this rest before you run out. Each participant may share their successes with anyone else as they please.

If you attempt a Skill test during a rest, you must spend actions equal to the difficulty of the test to attempt it. If you do not have enough actions, you may not attempt it.

If you have no Conditions, you may spend actions to gain a `Well Rested` enduring Boon (see below how many actions are required for a Boon of each rating).

| **`Well Rested` Boon Rating** |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  | 10  |
|:-----------------------------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|     **Actions Required**      |  1  |  3  |  6  | 10  | 15  | 21  | 28  | 36  | 45  | 55  |

Any unspent actions you have at the end of a rest are lost.



## Special Actions

During any rest, you have access to some special Skill tests.

#### Crafting

You may create new Preparations and improve Preparations you already own by testing Craft.

To create a Preparation, you must roll **1** success. The resulting Preparation will have a quality rating of **1.**

After being created, Preparations can only be improved by **1** rating at a time. To improve a Preparation from a quality rating of **2** to a quality rating of **3,** you must roll **3** successes etc.

Improving a Preparation with rating **0** (a Preparation that has fully degraded after being used) grants **1** extra die to the test.

#### Recovering

You may mend Conditions afflicting you or someone resting with you. You can only remove minor Conditions. Major Conditions can only be mitigated to moderate and moderate Conditions can only be mitigated to minor. You can only mitigate a Condition if you have an empty Condition slot available for the mitigated Condition.

To mend a minor Condition, you must roll **1** success. To mitigate a moderate Condition to a minor Condition, you must roll **2** successes. To mitigate a major Condition to a moderate Condition, you must roll **3** successes.

Mending one of your own Conditions increases the difficulty of the test by **1.**

#### Predicting the Weather

You may predict the weather by creating or changing a Trait on the game by testing Wilderness with Intuition. Choose a rating for the Trait you would like to create (if there is already a weather Trait with equal or greater rating, you must instead change the existing Trait; the difficulty is the current Trait's rating).

If you've rolled more successes than the chosen rating, the game gets the weather Trait of your choosing.

If you've rolled fewer successes or tied but still rolled at least **1** success, increase or reduce the rating of the current weather Trait by equal to half your successes (rounded down with a minimum of **1**). Otherwise, unfortunately, you gain nothing.

### Wilderness

During a rest in the wilderness, you have access to some additional, special skill test:

#### Foraging

You may forage in the wild by testing Wilderness. Choose a rating for the Boon you would like to create by foraging.

If you've rolled more successes than the chosen rating or tied, you create an enduring `Provisions` Boon with the chosen rating. It vanishes at the end of the rest.

If you've rolled fewer successes but still rolled at least **1** success, you gain an enduring `Provisions` Boon with rating equal to half your successes (rounded down with a minimum of **1**). Otherwise, unfortunately, you gain nothing.

---

### Settlements

During a rest in a settlement, you have access to some additional, special skill test:

#### Buying

You may buy Preparations in settlements by testing Resources. Choose a quality rating for the Preparation you would like to buy (Not all quality rating may be available everywhere, often quality rating above a town's [supply rating](Settlements#supply-rating) cannot be found).

If you've rolled more successes than the chosen quality rating, you gain the Preparation with the chosen quality rating.

If you've rolled fewer successes or tied but still rolled at least **1** success, you gain a Preparation with rating equal to half your successes (rounded down with a minimum of **1**). Otherwise, unfortunately, you gain nothing.

#### Selling

You may sell Preparations you own by testing Resources. Choose a Preparation to sell and discard any success exceeding the Preparation's quality rating. The remaining result is the offer you get in your current rest location. You may accept that offer or decline it. Either way the actions to attempt selling this Preparation are spent. If you accept, you gain a Currency Preparation for Resources of the local currency with rating equal to the successes you've rolled.

#### Working

You may spend your time working in the settlement. Choose a skill, and a difficulty for your work and spend actions accordingly (Not all work may be available everywhere).

Test the chosen skill against the difficulty. If you succeed, you gain a Currency Preparation for Resources of the local currency with rating equal to the chosen difficulty.

If you fail to succeed but still rolled at least **1** success, you gain a Currency Preparation with rating equal to half your successes (rounded down with a minimum of **1**). otherwise, unfortunately, you gain nothing.

#### Research

You may spend your time among scrolls and tomes to learn more about a specific subject and its Traits. Name the place, creature, or person you would like to know more about and test Resources with Reason. If you already know of a detrimental Trait from the subject you are studying, you may invoke it for this test.

For your chosen subject, treat the outcome of your roll as if it were a Trait with rating equal to the successes you rolled for the purposes of discovering Traits (see [Discovering Traits](Traits#discovering-traits)).

If you rolled more successes than the subject's highest rated secret, you also learn that you know everything there is to know about your subject.

A research roll may result in no new information if you do not roll enough successes.
