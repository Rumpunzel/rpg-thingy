Gear [Preparations](Preparations) may have additional properties, abilities (properties which may activated at the cost of quality rating), and/or [traits](traits) (which work as other traits do).	

These properties are only for their corresponding skill [conflicts](conflict), only when the Preparation is used, and only as long as the Preparation has a rating of at least **1.**

The traits may be invoked in whatever context seems appropriate.

Gear Preparations may be used with a different [Approach](Approaches) than they were intended for, but will only be treated as half its quality (rounded down) for that purpose.

Some Preparations may be only specifically be used to attack or defend. If they are used to attack or defend but weren't meant to do so, they will only be treated as half its quality (rounded down) for that purpose.
