Stuff about Adversaries

## Traits & Preparations

Adversaries gain no Favor and as such, it only makes sense that their traits work a little differently.

Most of the time keeping of track adversaries is enough work without keeping track of dice and Preparation ratings. For that reason, traits work a little differently for Adversaries than for player characters and may be used to replace Preparations.

An adversary's traits are not used to re-roll dice and instead are treated like [Preparations](Preparations) (that do not degrade) where they are applicable. So high rated traits make them incredibly dangerous to face ill-prepared.



> She manages a nice hit but the ghoul will not abandon its nest so easily and jumps past Cyrene's torch, clawing at her face. The ghoul rolls terribly, it has no Preparations, but it has the trait `Festering Fangs & Claws` with a rating of **2,** which works like a Preparation when it attacks, so Cyrene will have to roll **2** successes to evade the attack. She invokes the `Light Sensitivity` trait again to aid with her defense roll and, thankfully, she rolls **2** successes and lives to fight another round.



## Detrimental Traits

As opponents may use your detrimental traits, so you may use theirs, given you know they exist.

When you test a skill, you may spend **1** Favor to invoke one of your opponent's detrimental traits to add **1** die to your roll. Per test, you may invoke that trait a number of times up to the rating of the trait. Per test, you may only invoke a single of your opponent's detrimental traits per test. If your opponent has multiple detrimental traits which might fit, you have to choose only one of them.



> Cyrene tracks a ghoul through the sewers to its hiding place, where a fight erupts. Cyrene discovered the `Light Sensitivity` trait with rating **1** of ghouls while doing research and spends **1** Favor to invoke the trait to her advantage. She raises the torch in her hand as she rushes forward and adds **1** extra die to her attack roll as she blinds the ghoul with fire.



> In a back-alley duel, Maro wants to intimidate his foe. He test Influence with the Approach of Vigor and rolls **2** successes to create a Bane named `Cowed` with rating **2** on his opponent.
>
> Maro will invoke the Bane for free on his next attack and add **2** dice which will no doubt spell disaster for his opponent. He could have also invoked it for free on his defense.
