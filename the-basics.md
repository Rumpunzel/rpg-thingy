To play rpg-thingy you need one Game Master (**GM**) and a handful of players. Each player is responsible for one Player Character (**PC**) who exists in a fictional world. The GM's role is to bring the fictional world alive with descriptions, obstacles and Non-Player Characters (**NPCs**).

The PCs interact with the situation and the world presented by the GM by asking questions and narrating what they would like their characters to accomplish and how they would like to do so until the outcome of an action is no longer certain and the group consults the dice.



# Gameplay Pillars

In brief, the 5 pillars most important to playing rpg-thingy:

## Agency

- There are no actions without consequences
- Choose your own path and leave your mark on the world
- Be creative with the tools you have

## Exploration

- There are secrets hidden everywhere
- Venturing into dangerous parts of the world yields the biggest rewards
- Ask questions and pay attention

## Strategy

- There is always a goal to achieve or a wound to mend
- Always consider what you want to accomplish next and how to tackle it
- Face challenges and enemies as well-prepared as you can

## Heroism

- There is no greater act of heroism than facing what you are most afraid of
- Find what your character treasures and protect it
- Find what your character fears or struggles with most and face it

## Growth

- The world will fall to darkness without you to kindle its light
- Do no shy away from challenges and grow with them instead
- Live not to destroy but to build and improve




# Consulting the Dice

As mentioned above, the dice are consulted when the outcome of an action is uncertain. The outcome of an action is certain when you, for example, want to hit a training dummy, talk to your friends, or walk up a smooth wall. Either you either certainly can do what you want to or you certainly can't.

On the other hand, if you want to hit a baddie with your sword, bribe a guard, or try to walk across a tightrope you don't know how good the baddie is at fighting or how he fights with the sun is in his eye, if the guard is crooked or dutiful and will accept your bribe, or you queasy your character manages their nerves when the wind tugs at them as they balance across the chasm.

It's the moment we roll the dice to open a fleeting portal to the fictional world, so it may answer our questions.


## Tests

When you consult the dice, the game calls it a test.

rpg-thingy uses a **d6** dice pool system. So whenever the game calls for dice to be rolled, roll a handful of six-sided dice. Each die can either be a hit or a miss, depending on if its face shows at least a certain number. All hits counted together are called **Effort.** Achieving more Effort is always better.

A test has a difficulty, a number that defines how much Effort it takes to succeed on the test, otherwise the test is a failure. There are no tests without consequences. No matter if you succeed on a test or fail it, you will either get what you want or suffer a setback. Either way, a test progresses the narrative.

Tests are discussed in more detail in the following chapters.


## Certainty

</figure>

When asking _"Is the outcome of this action certain?",_ context and your goal are both important. If the baddie you want to hit with your sword, for example, is asleep, then there is no need to consult the dice; it is certain that you will hit. Knowledge the GM might have about the world or NPCs might also influence if an action is certain. If the GM, for example, knows that the guard is crooked, no roll is needed if the bribe is sufficient. Of course, if the GM does not know if the bribe is sufficient or if the player does not know if they can spare the expense, consult the dice.

Goals or context can also make trivial tasks uncertain. If you, for example, want to hit the training dummy to impress an onlooker, it may be certain that you will hit the dummy, but it is uncertain if the onlooker will be impressed, so you consult the dice.
