rpg-thingy is a Pen & Paper RPG. To play, you need pen, paper, a handful six-sided dice (**d6**), one player to assume the role of Game Master (**GM**) and 1-5 additional players who are each responsible for one Player Character (**PC**).  
PCs exist in a fictional world in which they act, struggle, and succeed. The players' role is to bring their PC to life and the GM's responsibility is to breath life into the rest of the fictional world with descriptions, challenges, and Non-Player Characters (**NPCs**).

The PCs interact with the situation and the world presented by the GM by asking questions and narrating what they would like their characters to accomplish and how they would like to do so until the outcome of an action is no longer certain and the group consults the dice (see [Consulting the Dice](#consulting-the-dice)).



# Playing a Character

To play a Player Character (**PC**) in rpg-thingy means to toke on the mantle of fictional character. You make choices on behalf of that fictional character. Choices that will put your character in danger, choices that will protect them from harm but never choices that take them out of trouble.

Characters in rpg-thingy are be valiant adventurers, daring scoundrels, wise sages, knights in shining armor, thrifty merchants, cunning diplomats, stoic smiths, disciplined spies, or even kindly bakers.  
They are people with goals who are competent in their area of expertise, but they cannot be competent at everything. It is inevitable that they will fail but characters in rpg-thingy shy away from such challenges.  
Failure is the best teacher, so they say.

Part of the fun of playing a character in rpg-thingy is watching them succeed at doing what they excel in and even more when they do so on nothing but naked luck. But most of the fun is watching them grow with their challenges, to be in their head as they surmount difficult challenges and face their demons.  
Be that literal demons, a missing leg, domineering egos, or a fear of public speaking. This is what makes them heroes. Not the number of monsters they slay, not the hoards of treasure they find, or the songs that are sung about them but for they face the challenges that scare them, personally, the most.

At their core, characters in rpg-thingy belief a truth that propels them forwards and a lie about the world or themselves that keeps them from achieving their full potential. They are emotional beings on an emotional journey to face that lie and this game is about that journey and when it ends, they must find another dragon to slay, so to say, or they no longer qualify to be PCs, as they settle down, travel to distant lands, or perish. Either better people because they faced their lie or worse for they fled when the abyss looked back into them.



# Consulting the Dice

  <figcaption>A fight is the classic situation where its outcome is anything but certain.</figcaption>
</figure>

As mentioned above, the dice are consulted when the outcome of an action is uncertain. The outcome of an action is certain when you, for example, want to hit a training dummy, talk to your friends, or walk up a smooth wall. Either you either certainly can do what you want to or you certainly can't.

On the other hand, if you want to hit a baddie with your sword, bribe a guard, or try to walk across a tightrope you don't know how good the baddie is at fighting or how he fights with the sun is in his eye, if the guard is crooked or dutiful and will accept your bribe, or how your character manages their nerves when the wind tugs at them as they balance across the chasm.

We might have a rough idea what is more likely to happen but we cannot know for certain. It's the moment we roll the dice to open a fleeting portal to the fictional world, so it may answer our questions.


## Tests

When you consult the dice, the game calls it a test.

rpg-thingy uses a **d6** dice pool system. So whenever the game calls for dice to be rolled, roll a handful of six-sided dice. Each die can either be a hit or a miss, depending on if its face shows at least a certain number. All hits counted together are called **Effort.** Achieving more Effort is always better.

A test has a difficulty, a number that defines how much Effort it takes to succeed on the test, otherwise the test is a failure. There are no tests without consequences. No matter if you succeed on a test or fail it, you will either get what you want or suffer a setback. Either way, after a test both the narrative and your character make progress, either by achieving your goal or by growing with your failures.

Tests are discussed in more detail in the following chapters.


## Certainty of Actions

When asking _"Is the outcome of this action certain?",_ the answer is most often found in three different places:opposition, character's goal, and potential outcomes.

### Opposition

If the baddie you want to hit with your sword is unconscious, asleep, or otherwise incapacitated, he cannot actively oppose your attempt to stab him and hence, there is no need to consult the dice; it is certain that you will hit.

Knowledge the GM might have about the world or NPCs might also influence if an action is certain. If the GM knows that the guard is crooked, no roll is needed if the bribe is sufficient, as the guard has no qualms which would oppose your attempted bribe. Of course, if the GM does not know if the bribe is sufficient or if the player does not know if they can spare the expense, consult the dice.

### Character Goals

A character's goals also influence the certainty of actions. If you want to hit the training dummy to impress an onlooker, it may be certain that you will hit the dummy, but it is uncertain if the onlooker will be impressed, so you consult the dice.

Stabbing a sleeping guard might be doable with certainty but doing so without alerting any of his fellow guards is by no means a certain task.

### Potential Outcomes

If an action has only one possible outcome, it is certain. And action needs at least two (interesting) outcomes to be uncertain. While it is true that, at least in theory, a character could trip and fall down the stairs every time, both walking down and falling down the stairs are intrinsically interesting, so the action is certain.

    <p><strong>When an action is certain</strong></p>
    <p>In brief, if there is no ulterior goal to an action, there is plenty of time to accomplish it, there is no opposition from either the world or another character, and there are fewer than two interesting outcomes, then an action is certain. Either you get what you want or the action is impossible, and you must find another way.
