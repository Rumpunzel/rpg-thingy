Sometimes during a scene or [Conflict](Conflict) you want to help yourself or an ally, or hinder an opponent. In that case, you may create a Boon to aid or a Bane to hinder. In Conflicts, you may to so during [Positioning](Conflict#positioning) and hence, also during the Conflict like any other Positioning.

When you test a skill to create a Boon or Bane, the number of successes (or excess successes if someone defends against your attempt) determines the Boon's/Bane's rating.

You may also turn excess successes after you have succeeded on a test into a Boon on yourself or, if you succeeded in a Contest, into a Bane on your opponent by spending up to **1** Favour for each excess success to create a Boon/Bane with rating equal to the amount of Favour spent this way.

When a Boon or a Bane is created, its creator associates it either with the [Approach,](Approaches) or the [Skill](Skills) they used to create it. If the Bane or Boon is created during a Conflict, its creator may choose attacking or defending instead of an Approach or a Skill.

- If an Approach was chosen, the Boon or Bane may only be used with the associated Approach but any Skill.
- If a Skill was chosen, the Boon or Bane may only be used with the associated Skill but any Approach.
- If attacking was chosen, the Boon or Bane may be used to attack during the Conflict with any Approach and any Skill but not to defend.
- If defending was chosen, the Boon or Bane may be used to defend during the Conflict with any Approach and any Skill but not to attack.
- If a Boon or Bane is used with a different action, Approach or Skill than intended, its rating is halfed (rounded down).

Boons & Banes only last for the context they were created in. In most cases that means for the duration of the Conflict or for the duration of the scene.



## Boons

A Boon may be used on any roll where it would make sense that it would help you. When you use a Boon, add dice equal to the Boon's rating to your roll. Though, after you do, the Boon is used up and vanishes.

If you have multiple Boons which might fit, you have to choose only one of them.

Boons with extraordinary high ratings may let you add a number of dice (as shown below) to your roll without using up the Boon and without it vanishing.

|                      **Boon Rating**                      |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  | 10  |
|:---------------------------------------------------------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Dice that can be added<br/>without the Boon vanishing** |  -  |  -  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  2  |  3  |  3  |  4  |  4  |



> Cyrene wants to hide and sneak behind enemy lines. The camp is well guarded; someone is expecting her. The GM sets the obstacle to sneak into the camp at **2.** Cyrene tests Maneuver with the Approach of Intuition as she steps from shadow to shadow and rolls a phenomenal **5** successes. Easily enough to succeed. She spends **1** Favour and turns the **3** excess successes into a Boon named `Hidden from Sight` with rating **3** on herself. She chooses to associate it with Intuition instead of Maneuver.
>
> In the enemy camp, she finds her target of her assassination mission: the loathsome merchant king Samson. Cyrene and the GM agree that they are more interested in the fallout of this event than the assassination itself, so murdering the merchant discretely and making it out unseen will be a resolved with a  single test with obstacle **3.**
>
> Cyrene's initial roll shows only **2** successes, but she may now invoke her Boon `Hidden from Sight` to gain **3** extra dice for her assassination attempt. The **3** extra dice turn her attempt into a success. The Boon has been used and vanishes and so does Cyrene into the night.



## Banes

Banes are temporary detrimental [Traits](Traits), though Banes, are one-use only. After a Bane increased the obstacle of a test or was used by an opponent to get extra dice, it vanishes.

If an opponent has multiple Banes which you might use to aid you, you have to choose only one of them.

A Bane is not itself one of your opponent's Traits, so you may invoke both a Boon and a detrimental Trait for additional dice.

If you are affected by a Bane, your opponent's may use it to add dice to their rolls during Contests and Conflicts. If you instead test against a static obstacle, it is always assumed that the GM compels your highest rated Bane.

Banes with extraordinary high ratings may let you add a number of dice (as shown below) to your roll without using up the Bane and without it vanishing.

|                      **Bane Rating**                      |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  | 10  |
|:---------------------------------------------------------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Dice that can be added<br/>without the Bane vanishing** |  -  |  -  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  2  |  3  |  3  |  4  |  4  |



> The caravan Maro is escorting is being ambushed. One of the bandits is covered in mean battle scars, so Maro decides to leverage his superior mobility before engaging him directly. He tries to create a Bane with Maneuver and Intuition on the bandit by throwing sand into his eyes, who fails to defend against the attempt. Maro rolls **2** excess successes and creates a Bane named `Sand in my Eyes!` with rating **2** on the bandit. He chooses to associate it with defending.
>
> Anyone attacking the bandit or defending against one of his attacks may now add **2** to their roll once, as either way, the Bane vanishes after it has been used.



## Enduring Boons & Banes

Sometimes either extremely powerful effects like magic or the GM for narrative reasons might create Boons or Banes that endure for longer but a moment.

An enduring Boon degrades by **1** rating when it is used to add half or more (rounded up) of its rating as dice to a roll (instead of vanishing like normal Boon would).

An enduring Bane degrades by **1** rating after its rating was added to an obstacle.

When an enduring Boon/Bane reaches a rating of **0,** it vanishes.

An enduring Boon/Bane only degrades whenever a normal Bane/Boon would degrade (so extremely high rated enduring Boons and Banes may last even longer).

Enduring Banes/Boons may exist beyond a single Conflict/scene, if it makes narrative sense.



> Cyrene and Maro have sneaked into a sleeping dragon's hoard to recover a long-lost artifact. The GM makes it quite clear that any test they fail while searching for the artifact will draw the attention of the dragon, though, thankfully, the dragon is asleep and has an enduring Bane on it called `Caught in a Deep Slumber` with a rating of **3** and associated with Intuition.
>
> Maro starts climbing the hoard of gold with a Maneuver test but the dice forsake him, and he rolls no successes. He invokes the `Caught in a Deep Slumber` Bane for free and adds **3** extra dice to his roll, turning it into a success, though the `Caught in a Deep Slumber` Bane degrades to a rating of **2** as a result. The dragon turns in his sleep, one eye almost opens but Maro remains unnoticed. The two of them have some breathing room before the dragon wakes. For now.
