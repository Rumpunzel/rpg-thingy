There are few things nicer than arriving in town after a long journey through the countryside, a hot bath tub and a nice feathery bed waiting for you. Though these nice luxuries, of course, did not fall from the sky.



## Supply Rating

As a general rule of thumb, the richer a town and the better its infrastructure, nicer it is to stay there. This rule of thumb is abstracted into a number that is called the supply rating of a settlement. When a character rests in a town, they may add its supply rating as dice to their roll.

**Eyeballing It:** If you simply need a quick number without much of the details: most towns in villages have a simple supply rating of **1.** Harbor towns and cities have a supply rating of **2,** and magnificently rich and capitols a supply rating of **3.**

Extremely lush forests or oases may also be given a supply rating when resting with [Wilderness](Skills#wilderness).

Thoughm RPG Thingy has a system for building towns and their surroundings from the ground up to determine their supply rating using [Preparations](Preparations) to abstract structures.



> Why would I want to put effort into calculating the supply rating of a town when I can simply assign a number and be done with it?
>
> In longer running campaigns, towns and cities will sometimes take on the role of characters. Mostly commonly that role will be Home.
>
> Home can be improved but Home can also be destroyed. Surely the mill being burned down by bandits will have some consequences for the town and its wealth. As GMs, we often flesh out these consequences with narrative weight. This system aims to also offer a tool to flesh them out even more with reasonable mechanical weight by making use of the Preparation system.

### Support Ratings

According to the Masterwork rule, Preparations with rating **3** or higher to not degrade for simple tests with only obstacle **1.** As Preparations can also structures, this has helpful implications for building a coherent and interconnected world. This **1** a structure Preparation can support is called its support rating.

The support rating of a structure Preparations is the highest obstacle of test it can be used for without degrading.



> A river parts the forest in two. Crossing it is no trivial task. The obstacle to cross it is **1.** A character could build a simple bridge across to cross. A bridge Preparation with rating **1** will help one character cross the river before collapsing (the river can still be crossed by succeeding on the obstacle **1** test without the help of the bridge). A bridge Preparation with rating **2** will help two characters cross the river but a bridge Preparation with rating **3** or higher does not degrade when used, as the obstacle against which it is used is only **1.**
>
> The bridge has a quality rating of **3** and a support rating of **1.**
>
> (Note that the bridge will still degrade by obstacles higher than its support rating, for example a ox and cart crossing the river, which would be a obstacle **2** test)

### Calculating Supply Rating

Settlements are, almost by definition, where multiple structures with a support rating of at least **1** accumulate.



> Next to the bridge with a support rating of **1,** a little town has formed around a magnificent mill Preparation with quality rating **5,** so its support rating is **2.**



A settlement's supply rating based on the surrounding Preparations and their support ratings is half of the sum of all relevant support ratings (rounded down).



> The bridge and mill around the town have a combined support rating of **3,** so the supply rating of the town is **1.** When characters rest in the town, they add an extra die to their rest roll.
>
> Should the existing Preparations be improved and/or new supporting structures be built around the town, its supply rating would improve. Should the existing Preparations degrade or be destroyed, its supply rating would decrease.

### Leisure Structures

Calculating supply rating already is a very handy tool to give characters to the towns and cities characters will visit. In some cases, though, they demand even more detail. For these cases, you can deploy leisture structures, who are always strongly associated with either a specific [Approach](Approach) or Condition type. They contribute their support rating to the settlement as normal, but also add dice equal tot heir support rating to recovery rolls made either with the corresponding Approach or for the corresponding Condition type.

Leisure structures might also allow for Skills to be used for the recovery roll than normal.

Per recovery roll, only **1** leisure structure may contribute additional dice.

Some examples for leisure structures are:

- A coliseum, which would be associated with Vigor and allow recovery rolls with Fight or Maneuver. Participating in the coliseum for a thrilling display of martial prowess, simply enjoying the show, or training on the sparring grounds will add dice equal to its the coliseum's support rating to all recovery tests made with Vigor.
- A palace garden, which would be associated with Intuition and allow recovery rolls with Resources or Wilderness. Going for a serene stroll through the water gardens, washing the dirt off bruised flesh, or watching a reenactment will add dice equal to the palace garden's support rating to all recovery tests made with Intuition.
- An academy, which would be associated with Reason and allow recovery rolls with Influence or Resources. Getting aid from a trained surgeon or banker, or spending some quiet time in the library will add dice equal to its the academy's support rating to all recovery tests made with Reason.
- A hospital, which would be associated with physical Conditions with Influence or Resources by acquiring medical care.
- A theater, which would be associated with mental Conditions and allow recovery rolls with Maneuver or Craft by processing your troubles in drama.
- A courthouse, which would be associated with worldly Conditions and allow recovery rolls with Influence or Fight by proving (or *proving)* your innocence. 



> After a tumultuous journey, Maro arrives in the city of Artir, famed for its magnificent bathhouse. He could have made for a different town but he wanted to return to exactly here. After dealing with cutthroats and turncloaks at every corner, taking Conditions left and right, he is exhausted beyond words. When he finally steps into the steamy halls, bliss finally returns to him.
>
> Because of the city's respectable supply rating of **4,** Maro achieved enough successes to possibly rid himself of all his Conditions, if he manages to success on all recovery tests. Thankfully, he can add the bathhouse's impressive support rating of **3** (its total quality rating is **7**) to his Intuition recovery rolls and emerges Condition-free, even with a `Well Rested` Boon to boot. Should fate befall him again like this, he is sure to return. And should something threaten the splendid city of Artir, Maro will rush to aid without hesitation, to protect the city and her wonderful bathhouse.
