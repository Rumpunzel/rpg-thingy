# Certainty of Actions

As mentioned previously, the dice are only consulted when the outcome of an action is not certain. When asking _"Is the outcome of this action certain?",_ the answer is found in three different places: opposition, character's goal, and potential outcomes.

In brief, if there is no ulterior goal to an action, there is plenty of time to accomplish it, there is no opposition from either the world or another character, and there are fewer than two interesting outcomes, then an action is certain. Either you get what you want or the action is impossible, and you must find another way.


## Opposition

Most often an action is uncertain because either another character, a creature, or the environment is opposing you.

</figure>

Hitting a baddie with your sword, bribing a guard, or walking across a tightrope are uncertain actions because you face opposition. The baddie does not want to be stabbed, the guard has a duty to fulfill, and the wind pulls at your clothes as if it wanted to drag you into the ravine.

Most of the time this means either a character or the scene has a trait making the action you are trying to undertake uncertain. As described below, that trait's rating will mark the difficulty for your test.

On the other hand, if the baddie you want to hit with your sword is unconscious, asleep, or otherwise incapacitated, he cannot actively oppose your attempt to stab him and hence, there is no need to consult the dice; it is certain that you will hit.

If it has been established that the guard you want to bribe is crooked, no roll is needed if the bribe is sufficient, as the guard has no qualms which would oppose your attempted bribe. Of course, if you do not know if the bribe is sufficient, or you do not know if you can spare the expense, consult the dice.

[Assets](/assets) also can make otherwise uncertain actions certain. Crossing a gaping ravine becomes quite a lot simpler if there is a bridge across it. If it has not been maintained for a long time, though, the dice await.


## Character Goals

A character's goals also influence the certainty of actions. If you want to hit the training dummy to impress an onlooker, it may be certain that you will hit the dummy, but it is uncertain if the onlooker will be impressed, so you consult the dice.

Stabbing a sleeping guard might be doable with certainty but doing so without alerting any of his fellow guards is by no means a certain task.


## Potential Outcomes

Most importantly, if an action has only one (interesting) outcome, it is certain.  While it is true that, at least in theory, a character could trip and fall down the stairs every time, both walking down and falling down the stairs are absolutely uninteresting, so the action is certain and simply happens.

A test and the corresponding dice roll in rpg thingy should always move the narrative forward. If you find yourself at the same point after a test as you did before, the test was uninteresting and should not have been made.



# Improving with Failure

When you fail a skill test, you do not get what you want, but you mark **XP** for the skill you used equal to the number of hits you rolled on that test (not the amount of effort you achieved, so using assets cannot gain you additional **XP**).  
Apart from completing goals, this is the only way go gain **XP** for your skills, though using your own traits to increase a test's difficulty can result in more **XP** than you would get normally.



# Uncontested Tests

Uncontested tests are the most basic form of test. They are also the least dramatic and the least dangerous.

<div class="callout">
    <p><strong>When is a Test Uncontested?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>There is no other character or creature to directly or indirectly keep you from achieving your goal</li>
        <li>Another character or creature tries to keep you from achieving your goal, but they do not have any other goals of their own</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="callout">
    <p><strong>Examples of Uncontested Tests</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Jumping a ravine</li>
        <li>Haggling with a merchant</li>
        <li>Forging a weapon</li>
        <li>Quietly murdering a guard keeping watch</li>
        <li>Buying a horse</li>
    </ul>
</div>


## Resolving Uncontested Tests

As mentioned above, most often uncontested tests result from an environmental trait that would noticeably hinder your effort or a character or creature with a trait that would noticeably hinder your effort opposing you. The trait's rating is the test's difficulty.

<figure>
  <img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/b3f979912d36f99ba5b7be80c1707c14/tumblr_oq2608N2Bs1ro2bqto1_1280.jpg" alt="Late-Night Mugging">
  <figcaption>Even a good ol' late-night mugging can be resolved with a single die roll.</figcaption>
</figure>

Should it ever be unclear what difficulty a test is supposed to be, it will most likely be **1;** you only need to achieve **1** effort to succeed.

If both an environmental and an opponent's trait would notably hinder your efforts, add their ratings together to determine the test's difficulty.  
Only add the rating of **1** environmental trait and/or **1** opponent's trait to the difficulty of an uncontested test. When multiple would apply, choose the highest or most relevant.

If the difficulty of an uncontested test ever exceeds **3,** consider the characters' goals to determine if a single die roll really is the best way to resolve the situation or if a more detailed conflict would be more appropriate.

### Let It Ride

If you fail a test, you may not repeat the test with the same skill and attribute again until something fundamentally changes about the situation. You may attempt a different attribute but the difficulty of the test might increase.

You may always change your approach and use a different skill to achieve your goal a different way.

### Powering Through

When you fail an uncontested test, you may still succeed at a cost, you may power through.

To do so, gain a [Condition](/conditions-and-resting#conditions) with a rating equal to the difference between the test's difficulty and the effort you achieved. Name the Condition something appropriate to represent your exhaustion, strain, or injury from powering through.

Instead of failing the test, you succeed by concentrated power of will (as you succeed on the test, you do not mark any **XP**).

> Cyrene wants to enter the sultan's city but the gates are closed and will not open before sunrise. She decides to try her luck anyway. As she approaches the gate, she winks at the younger of the two guards.
>
> The skill is obvious in this scenario, she wants to Influence the guards to let her pass. Cyrene is trained at Influence, so for her every face of a **5** or higher is a success.
>
> For her Approach, she settles on Intuition. She is going with the flow, trying to draw something out of the guards to turn to her advantage. As her rating for Intuition is **5,** she will roll **5** dice.
>
> The GM decides an uncontested test will suffice to convincing the guards to let Cyrene pass.
>
> The sultan's city has the trait `Under Martial Law` with a rating of **2** so the difficulty for the test is also **2.** The curfew turns an otherwise trivial task into a challenge.
>
> Cyrene throws her **5** dice. Two dice come up **1** and. As she chose Intuition as her Approach, she uses her trait `Charming Stranger` to re-roll those **1s.** Her result now is **2, 3, 4, 4, 6.** All dice which come up **5+** are hits for her, so she achieved **1** effort; not enough to succeed. She came to the city to rest not exhaust herself even more, so she decides against powering through.
>
> She marks **1** **XP** for the **1** effort she achieved, but now she must try another way to get into the city. She could try to frighten the guards into letting her pass, but with them already looking irritated and with her Vigor rating of **3,** she fears this might go poorly for her and so decides against it.


## Group Tests

Characters may act in tandem with each other when trying to achieve the same goal while testing the same skill (they may use different attributes, though most of the time, they will also use the same attributes). When they do, everyone tests and adds their successes together to determine if they manage to succeed as a group.

When two or more character use the same skill and the same attribute to achieve the same goal, they always test as a group.

During uncontested tests, for each participant beyond the first, the difficulty of the test is increased by **1.**

Group tests can be incredible tools to achieve great deeds. They can also simply be used to help your compatriots to overcome obstacles you find trivial. But they come at the cost of increasing the risk for all participants. You either win or you fail as a group.

When a group fails an uncontested test, each member of the group receives **XP** equal to the effort they individually mustered.

A group can power through but _each_ member of the group must take a Condition with a rating equal to the difference between the test's difficulty and the effort they, individually, achieved.

> Outside the city, Cyrene meets up with her travel companion Maro, who comes to her with grave news. They definitely need to enter the sultan's city _tonight._ Luckily, Maro remembers scaffolding at the south wall he passed by a few days ago. When they arrive fortune is on their side. Only a few guards in sight. But scaling the city wall undetected will still not be an easy task.
>
> The city wall has the trait `Weathered & Steep` with a rating of **2,** so the difficulty for the test is **2** but because of the `Martial Law`, there are guards on the wall `Keeping Watch` which increases the difficulty by **1** which is now **3** because they want to enter the city unseen.
>
> Though, they can use the `Scaffolding` trait with rating **1** to their advantage.
> 
> Cyrene and Maro attempt to climb the wall as a group, which increases the difficulty by **1** to **4.** They both test their Maneuver with Vigor (as the task will require endurance more than anything else). They both invoke the `Scaffolding` trait to add **1** additional die to their roll. Cyrene rolls **2** hits and so does Maro for a total of **4** effort; just enough to succeed.
> 
> Alone, none of them would not have managed to scale the wall undetected, but together they prevailed, and now they are finally inside.



# Contests

When another character, creature, or even multiple not only want to keep you from achieving your goal but have a goal of their own; or when you want to keep them from achieving their goal, the action is resolved in a contest.

<div class="callout">
    <p><strong>Examples of Contests</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>A race to the finish line</li>
        <li>A bidding war at an auction</li>
        <li>Two rivals competing to see who can forge the better weapon</li>
        <li>A tavern brawl to impress a patron</li>
        <li>Taming a horse that wants to eat your underwear</li>
    </ul>
</div>


## Resolving a Contest

The defender makes a test; the achieved effort sets the difficulty of the contest for the attacker. Then, the attacker tests to try to beat the difficulty.

<figure>
  <img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2QqI8vSa9rQ/VKQ_ANDE7OI/AAAAAAAAEC4/XMvpPVWuUSU/s1600/10580257_10153055484583135_371744883842036670_n.jpg" alt="Magic Duel">
  <figcaption>A duel between mages can be resolved with a single contest.</figcaption>
</figure>

If the attacker succeeds, they get what they want but the defender does not. The attacker also inflicts an appropriate Condition on the defender with rating equal to the difference in effort.

If the attacker fails, they do not get what they want but the defender does. The defender also inflicts an appropriate Condition on the attacker with rating equal to the difference in effort.

On ties the defender wins but without inflicting a Condition.

## Traits during Contests

During contests, using your own traits to your detriment does not increase the difficulty for yourself but works a little differently. You also have access to your opponents' detrimental traits to exploit for your advantage.

### Opponents' traits

During a contest, you may invoke **1** of your opponent's detrimental traits which is known to you by describing how you would leverage that trait to your advantage. If the group agrees that your creative efforts would result in an advantage for you, add its rating as dice to your roll.  
You may only invoke a single of your opponent's detrimental traits per test. If your opponent has multiple fitting detrimental traits, you may only choose **1** of them. If you are testing against multiple opponents, you may also choose **1** trait from among all their traits.

Once you have invoked an opponent's trait during a scene, you may do so until the scene ends or the scene changes so that your previous description would no longer grant you an advantage without having to go into detail how you would leverage that trait to your advantage.

You may invoke both an environmental _and_ one of your opponent's traits on the same roll.

> Cyrene tracks a ghoul through the sewers to its hiding place, where a fight erupts. Cyrene discovered the `Light Sensitivity` trait with rating **2** of ghouls while doing research and raises the torch in her hand as she rushes forward. Everyone at the table agrees that she can invoke the trait to her advantage, both when attacking and defending, this way, and she adds **2** die to her attack roll as she blinds the ghoul with fire. As long as she has her torch in this fight with the ghoul, she may add **2** additional die to her attack and defense rolls.

### Detrimental traits

When you test with a skill in a contest, you may also use your traits to your detriment. Though, in most cases, your opponent will be the one to have that idea first. Instead of increasing the difficulty, using a trait to your detriment during a contest, lets your opponent add your trait's rating as dice to their roll.

When one of your traits is used against you this way, you may spend **1** Favor to not give your opponent any dice, similarly like you would during uncontested tests.

> During a kerfuffle at court, Cyrene tries to embarrass one of the guests she met previously (when he crossed her during a previous adventure). She only manages **1** success on her roll, though he manages none at all, he invokes Cyrene's `Drunkard` trait against her to add **1** die to his roll. Cyrene may now spend **1** Favor to not give him that additional die, but she wants to see what will happen and decides against it.
>
> The obnoxious guest manages to roll a success on his additional die and turns the outcome into a tie, which he, as the defender, wins. The court is now laughing at Cyrene, as he deflects her insults right back into her face. What a windbag. At least she received **1** **XP** for her Influence from her **1** success.


## Group Contests

When a group tests during contests, the opposing side of the group adds **1** die for each participant beyond the first. When two or more groups test against each others, each side adds **1** die for each participant on the opposing side beyond the first (this will get incredibly dangerous very quickly).

When a group fails a contest, the opposing side inflict a Condition to _each_ member of the group with a rating equal to the difference between the test's difficulty and the effort they individually mustered.


## Rulings

In most cases, both the defender and the attacker test the same skill, though with the attribute of their choice. In some circumstances it might make sense to test different Skills, though those occasions will be uncommon.

Sometimes there is no obvious defender for a contest. In that case, without defender for the contest, on a tie, everyone loses. The GM may also introduce an unexpected defender to win instead in that scenario.

There may be multiple attacking teams during a contest (though there is only ever **1** defending team) but there can only ever be a single winner; the attacking team, who achieves the greatest effort wins the conflict. If two or more attacking teams are tied for greatest effort, they all lose and a different attacking team (or the defending team, if they are the only one left) win instead.



# Conflicts

In general, a contest can handle any interaction between two or more characters; disagreements, arm-wrestling, races, even fights with only one test for each side.  
And uncontested Tests handle everything else without an opposing side; athletic challenges, public speeches, travelling, and even murder.  
But a single roll does not always have enough weight to justify its effect on the narrative. For those occasions, when the stakes are high and the current scene requires a more dramatic resolution, rpg-thingy offers a more intricate resolution mechanic called a [conflict](/conflict). In essence, it is a series of contests but with a lot more room for details and casualties. They are detailed in their own chapter.

Contests work especially well for important fights, long-winded chases, heartfelt debates, and even continent-spanning journeys.



# Resolving Tests in Revue

- Choose a goal to achieve.
- Describe what action you would like to undertake in the fiction.
- Choose a skill according to your goal and described action.
- Pick an [Attribute](/character#Attributes). If you have already described an action, try and go with the Attribute most fitting your description. Otherwise, let your choice of Attribute guide your roleplay.
- Determine if the test will be uncontested, a contest, or a conflict.
- **Roll the dice.**
- The target number for your dice is determined by the skill you've chosen. Every face of a die that comes up as at least that number, is a hit, all others are misses.
- Invoke traits, use traits to you detriment, and spend Favor.
- Determine the outcome of the test. If you succeeded, you get what you want, otherwise mark **XP** equal to the number of hits you rolled.
