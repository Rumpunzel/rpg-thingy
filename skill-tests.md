# Certainty of Actions

When asking _"Is the outcome of this action certain?",_ the answer is found in three different places: opposition, character's goal, and potential outcomes.

In brief, if there is no ulterior goal to an action, there is plenty of time to accomplish it, there is no opposition from either the world or another character, and there are fewer than two interesting outcomes, then an action is certain. Either you get what you want or the action is impossible, and you must find another way.

## Opposition

Most often an action is uncertain because either another character, a creature, or the environment is opposing you.

Hitting a baddie with your sword, bribing a guard, or walking across a tightrope are uncertain actions because you face opposition. The baddie does not want to be stabbed, the guard has a duty to fulfill, and the wind pulls at your clothes as if it wanted to drag you into the ravine.

On the other hand, if the baddie you want to hit with your sword is unconscious, asleep, or otherwise incapacitated, he cannot actively oppose your attempt to stab him and hence, there is no need to consult the dice; it is certain that you will hit.

If it has been established that the guard you want to bribe is crooked, no roll is needed if the bribe is sufficient, as the guard has no qualms which would oppose your attempted bribe. Of course, if you do not know if the bribe is sufficient or you do not know if you can spare the expense, consult the dice.

[Assets](assets) also can make otherwise uncertain actions certain. Crossing a gaping ravine becomes quite a lot simpler if there is a bridge across it. If it has not been maintained for a long time, though, the dice await.

## Character Goals

A character's goals also influence the certainty of actions. If you want to hit the training dummy to impress an onlooker, it may be certain that you will hit the dummy, but it is uncertain if the onlooker will be impressed, so you consult the dice.

Stabbing a sleeping guard might be doable with certainty but doing so without alerting any of his fellow guards is by no means a certain task.

## Potential Outcomes

If an action has only one possible outcome, it is certain. And action needs at least two (interesting) outcomes to be uncertain. While it is true that, at least in theory, a character could trip and fall down the stairs every time, both walking down and falling down the stairs are intrinsically interesting, so the action is certain.



# Skill Tests

Choose a goal to achieve.

Describe what action you would like to undertake in the fiction.

Choose a skill according to your goal and described action.

Pick an [Approach.](Approaches) If you have already described an action, try and go with the approach most fitting. Otherwise, let your choice of approach guide your roleplay.

The GM may give you an additional die for great roleplay/clever thinking.

If there are obstacles or even other people in your path but they don't necessarily have of their own apart fro getting in your way, the GM sets a Static Obstacle for the test.

Otherwise, if there is someone in the scene who would stop you while trying to achieve a goal of their own, then it's a contest and you roll against them. Almost always this means they use the same Skill, though they may choose whatever Approach they like. A [Conflict](Conflict) is a series of Contests.

Roll all your dice. If you are in a Contest, your opponent also rolls their dice.

Resolve your chosen Approach's dice modifier.

The target number for your dice is determined by the skill you've chosen. Every face of a die that comes up as at least that number, is a success, all others are failures.

Determine if you rolled more successes than the obstacle:

- **YES:** you get what you want.
- **TIE:** for tests against Static Obstacles, ties count as successful roles; for Contests, ties mean either the defender or no one wins (depending on what would make most sense in the contest).
- **NO:** you do not get what you want. You gain **1** [Favor](Favor) for each success you've rolled.

**Let It Ride:** If you fail a test, you may not repeat this combination of Skill and Approach again until something fundamentally changes about the situation.


> Cyrene wants to enter the sultan's city but the gates are closed and will not open before sunrise. She decides to try her luck anyway. As she approaches the gate, she winks at the younger of the two guards.
>
> The Skill is obvious in this scenario, she wants to Influence the guards to let her pass. Cyrene is trained at Influence, so for her every face of a **5** or higher is a success.
>
> For her Approach, she settles on Intuition. She is going with the flow, trying to draw something out of the guards to turn to her advantage. As her rating for Intuition is **5,** she will roll **5** dice.


## Setting Static Obstacles

The base obstacle for any test is **1.** Whenever it is unclear what the obstacle for a test will be, assume it to be **1,** so you succeed by rolling at least **1** success.

Of course, things can get more complicated. Circumstances such as Traits on the scene will increase the obstacle.

In general, a Static Obstacle will always be between **1** and **3.** Should a Static Obstacle ever exceed **3,** considering resolving the problem in a Conflict instead.

There are some Static Obstacles which work a little differently. When improving Preparations, for example, the obstacle depends on the Preparations rating and may even exceed **3.** These kinds of tests do not require Conflicts to be resolved, they are simply very rare occurences for a master to display their skill.

**Power Through:** In some cases, you might want to succeed at a cost. You may increase the number of successes you have rolled up to obstacle number (though by no more than **3**), then you gain a Condition with a rating equal to the number of successes you added this way representing your exhaustion as you powered through to your goal and turn the roll into a success.


> The GM decides convincing the guards to let Cyrene pass will not require more than a Static Obstacle.
>
> The base obstacle for the test is **1** but the sultan's city has the Trait `Under Martial Law` with a rating of **1** and the curfew will make it harder for Cyrene to get into the city. The GM increased the obstacle by the Trait's rating and it is now **2.**
>
> Cyrene throws her **5** dice. Two dice come up **1** and, as she chose Intuition as her Approach, she can roll those dice again. Her result now is **2, 3, 4, 4, 6.** All dice which come up **5+** are successes for her, so she did get **1** success. Had there not been a curfew, she would have gotten into the city. She decides not to Power Through, she came to the city to rest not exhaust herself even more.
>
> She gains **1** Favor, as she was **1** success short of achieving her goal and must now try another way to get into the city. She could try to frighten the guards into letting her pass, but with her Vigor rating of **3,** she fears this might go poorly for her and decides against it.


# Group Tests

Sometimes characters act in tandem with each other, using the same Skill and the same approach to achieve the same goal. When they do, everyone tests and adds their successes together to determine if they manage to succeed as a group.

For each participant beyond the first, the difficulty for the test is increased by **1.**

When a group is opposed in a Contest, the opposing side adds **1** die for each participant beyond the first.

When a group test fails, each character in the group resolves eventual repercussions (including Favor) independently, comparing their successes to the test's obstacle.



> Outside the city, Cyrene meets up with her travel companion Maro, who comes to her with grave news. They must defininitely need to enter the sultan's city tonight. Maro remembers scaffolding at a piece of collapsing wall. When they arrive they are in luck. Not guards in sight. But scaling the city wall will not be an easy task.
>
> The GM sets the obstacle to climb the wall at **2.** Cyrene and Maro attempt to climb the wall together, which increased the obstacle to **3.** They both test their Maneuver and choose the Approach Reason as they try to infiltrate into the city. Maro only rolls **1** success but, thankfully, Cyrene rolls **2** successes for a total of **3**. Alone, Maro would not have managed to scale the wall but together they prevailed and are finally inside.


# Disposition

The three {{ site.attribute }}s do not only form the foundation of your character but of all other characters and creatures you will encounter on your adventures, sometimes even the environment itself.

The scoundrel, who ambushes you in the gloomy ally; the moonlit lord, who anticipates your every move; even passive obstacles such as a river's roaring current, they all have {{ site.attribute }}s just like you. And just like you, they have a Disposition, so tread carefully.

When you create your character you have the choice between two different dispositions, a representation of how your characters engages with his surroundings.

Your Disposition may force your target to perfectly defend against you. Which means, during Conflicts they may only defend themself but not their team's Morale when defending with an Approach against which your chosen Approach is positively dispositioned.

Your disposition represents a certain knack you have against the other approaches, a weakness you might exploit. But beware, for your enemies also have dispositions!

#### Disposition I

**Reason must defend perfectly against your Vigor:** You are a force too overwhelming, your attacks are too mighty, your speeches are too gripping, they cannot be faced with a cool demeanour for you leave no demeanour cool.

**Vigor must defend perfectly against your Intuition:** You change course too deftly, your attacks are a stunning barrage, your lies are too tricky a web to navigate, they cannot be faced head-on with brute force for you bend like grass in the wind.

**Intuition must defend perfectly against your Reason:** Your plans are too well thought out, your attacks are too precise, your rhetorical traps are too sophisticated, they cannot be weaseled out of for you have thought of everything.

#### Disposition II

**Intuition must defend perfectly against your Vigor:** You are a force too overwhelming, your attacks are too mighty, your speeches are too gripping, they cannot be faced with the cowardice of a weasel for you leave no place left to hide.

**Reason must defend perfectly against your Intuition:** You change course too deftly, your attacks are a stunning barrage, your lies are too tricky a web to navigate, they cannot be faced with a cool demeanour for they still think about your last move while your are crossing the finish line.

**Vigor must defend perfectly against your Reason:** Your plans are too well thought out, your attacks are too precise, your rhetorical traps are too sophisticated, they cannot be faced head-on with brute force for every careless step spells disaster.
