Your opponent cannot defend against your efforts with the attribute you are disposed against. Your opponent still damages your Morale as normal, if they achieve more effort than you. Surrendering . During their turn, a character may choose to surrender and remove themselves from the conflict. They can no longer influence the outcome, but they are out of harm’s way.

    "content": "People are the very heart of this roleplaying game. Their struggles, their virtues, their faults, and their relationships; in short: stories. There are also battles, monsters, intrigue, and treasure, but they only matter in their relation to people. Who would care about a monster that scares no one, who about a treasure that no one wants, who about a throne in a kingdom without people? . Your character is one of these people, but they matter more than any of the others because through them, you influence the world. But in a way, they are also how you experience the fictional world. A world that is dangerous, awe-inspiring, and full of people who are convinced just as you are that they are the hero of this (or at least their) story. Though you actually are the hero of this story. And that is no light responsibility to bear. They — and, by proxy, you — are the heart of all the drama. To you, there is no monsters more important than the one that most scare your character and no treasure more precious than the one they covet most. So your characters needs something to care about, something that motivates them to put themselves in harm’s way. And they need something to terrify them, something they dare not even look at for there seems no way to overcome it. rpg-thingy calls these the Truth and the Lie your character believes. A lie they must grow to face and a truth to keep them pressing on, to forge a story wroth remembering. And who knows, perhaps we might even grow a little with them. ",

The sign of a good Truth is that whenever you find yourself in a tricky situation or unsure what to do next, you can look at your character sheet, and it nudges you into the right direction. The Truth you formulate for your character is incredibly useful for your fellow players. It tells everyone at the table what you want to do with your character.

    "content": "Just like the Truth your character believes in, you can phrase the Lie your they believe either as a statement about them or as something they regularly think or say, though the Lie is not objectively true. To be more precise, it comes in two different flavors: . A conviction your character believes to be true, wittingly or unwittingly, though it is a delusion, a self-deception or misjudgement about their surroundings that you, as a player, know to be incorrect. The central questions such a Lie poses are: How will the character learn? What will it take? Where will it take? Will they find the courage to face the truth when push comes to shove? . I owe the Order of the Silver Falcon my life. There is no nobler goal than to give my life to repay my debt. I have left my life as a mercenary behind me. Is now a well-adjusted, productive member of society. A conjecture about your character that might or might not be true. Neither your character nor you know if it true or not. A Lie that is a conjecture is often possibly true and the character’s journey will consist of them proving that they were right to believe so from the start or learn the hard way that they were mistaken. The central question such a Lie poses is: Is this true? . “I am not worthy to inherit my master’s workshop.” . “The traitor who killed my father must die.” . As you can see, the same phrase can be used either as a Truth or a Lie, though its meaning drastically shifts. As a Truth, \"The traitor who killed my father must die.\" is a goal your character has that they will either fulfill or die trying. As a Lie, it is meant to be challenged as the story progresses. Does he indeed deserve to die? What did my father do that he was betrayed and murdered? Am I at fault for my father’s death? These are all questions that only result from Lies, for they are meant to be challenged, not from Truths. ",

    "content": "Gear Assets are more specific versions of general assets. They work just like normal assets but have additional properties. These properties are only for their corresponding skill Conflicts, only when the asset is used on a skill test to gain minimum effort. An asset’s properties can only be used as long as it has a quality rating of at least 1. Some assets may be only specifically be used to attack or defend. If they are used for minimum effort to attack or defend but weren’t meant to do so, it is treated as an Off-Label Use. Whether an asset is used to attack is signified by a 🗡 and by a 🛡 if it is meant to defend. Sometimes a different skill is listed, such as a Longbow is used to for Maneuver during Fight conflicts. If there is no additional information given, the gear asset is neither meant to attack nor defend, though it may, of course, still be used for that as an off-label use. Outside of conflicts, gear assets may be used on skill tests regardless if they were meant for attacking or defending as long as it makes sense in the narrative. Gear assets will become significantly more powerful when they are masterpieces, as you may use their abilities more often without degrading the asset. Gear assets list a specific resource required to both create and improve them. When spending resources to craft while resting, at least one of them needs to be the listed resource for you to attempt the test. Some gear asset list an additional resource. You need one of each resource to create or improve the asset. In addition, if an additional resource is listed, it increases the number of resources required for any Craft tests by 1. This does not increase the crafting test’s difficulty, though this does increase the difficulty of tests to buy and sell the gear asset. Rarely, gear assets require another masterpiece quality gear asset to be created. The difficulty for the test to create the new asset is the required asset’s masterpiece rating, which is lost in the process (on either success or failure). If the test was successful, the desired gear asset is created and rating for the newly created asset is the required asset’s masterpiece rating. After being created, the asset can be improved like any other asset. When buying and selling such an asset, its quality rating is considered to be doubled. A gear asset may have a trait called Exquisite. This trait is relevant for Influence, Craft, and Resource tests, concerning the asset itself. Meaning an asset’s Exquisite trait will increase the difficulty to create, improve, and buy it. Though it may also be invoked in social situations. Additionally, increase your effort by 1 when selling and Exquisite asset. A gear asset may also have a property called Fortified. A Fortified asset’s masterpiece rating is equal to its full quality rating, even outside of conflicts. At the top of each category of gear, there is also generic variant without properties. They do not require specific resources to be crafted as they are simply normal assets. Of course, they are still associated with an attribute, just like any other asset. Use these for, for example, improvised weapons or instead of its lengthy list of gear entirely. Why use Gear? . You can play rpg-thingy without gear entirely, as assets are an already useful abstractions. If you use gear, you should use them for the purpose for which I designed them: . | To add meaningful choices to conflicts | Because I think they’re neat | . So if, for example, your game does not have a lot of Fight conflicts, gear adds little meaningful choice and may be neglected. Or simply use them cause you think they’re neat. ",

Pictured: me writing rules about imagining fighting monsters in a fictional world. PCs exist in a fictional world in which they act, struggle, and succeed. The players’ role is to bring their PC to life and the GM’s responsibility is to breath life into the rest of this fictional world with descriptions, challenges, and Non-Player Characters (NPCs).

Choices that will put your character in danger, choices that will protect them from harm but never choices that take them out of trouble. \"You enter the forest at the darkest point, where there is no path.\" — Joseph Campbell Characters in rpg-thingy heroes and heroes come in many forms. They can be valiant adventurers, daring scoundrels, wise sages, knights in shining armor, thrifty merchants, cunning diplomats, stoic smiths, disciplined spies, or even kindly bakers. They are people with goals who are competent in their area of expertise, but they cannot be competent at everything. It is inevitable that they will fail but characters in rpg-thingy shy away from such challenges. Failure is the best teacher, so they say. Part of the fun of playing a character in rpg-thingy is watching them succeed at what they excel and even more when they do so on nothing but naked luck. But most of the fun is watching them grow with their challenges, to be in their head as they surmount difficult challenges and face their demons. Be that literal demons, a missing leg, a domineering ego, or a fear of public speaking. This is what makes them heroes in the end. Not the number of monsters they slay, not the hoards of treasure they find, or the songs that are sung about them, but that they face the challenges that scare them the most. At their core, characters in rpg-thingy believe a truth that propels them forwards and a lie about the world or themselves that keeps them from achieving their full potential. They are emotional beings on an emotional journey to face that lie and this game is about that journey. And when it ends, they must find another dragon to slay, so to say, or they no longer qualify to be PCs, as they settle down, travel to distant lands, or perish. Either as better people because they faced their lie or worse for they fled when the abyss looked back into them. More about characters and how to create on in the chapter about Characters. ",

It’s the moment we roll the dice to open a fleeting portal to the fictional world, so it may answer our questions. A fight is the classic situation where its outcome is anything but certain. When you consult the dice, the game calls it a Skill Test. rpg-thingy uses a d6 dice pool system. So whenever the game calls for dice to be rolled, roll a handful of six-sided dice. Each die can either be a hit or a miss, depending on if its face shows at least a certain number. All hits counted together are called Effort. Achieving more Effort is always better. A test has a difficulty, a number that defines how much Effort it takes to succeed on the test, otherwise the test is a failure. There are no tests without consequences. No matter if you succeed on a test or fail it, you will either get what you want or suffer a setback. Either way, after a test both the narrative and your character make progress, either by achieving your goal or by growing with your failures. As mentioned above, the dice are consulted when the outcome of an action is uncertain. Skill Tests and the Certainty of Actions are discussed in more detail in their respective chapter. ",

As such, when you use a support rating to add dice to your roll, your minimum effort for that test is equal to the structure’s support rating. Leisure structures might also allow for skills to be used for recovery tests other than normal. Per recovery test, only 1 leisure structure may contribute additional dice. Some examples for leisure structures are: . | A coliseum, which would be associated with Vigor and allow recovery tests to be made with Fight or Maneuver by participating in the coliseum for a thrilling display of martial prowess, simply enjoying the show, or training on the sparring grounds. | A palace garden, which would be associated with Intuition and allow recovery tests with Means or Wilderness by going for a serene stroll through the water gardens, washing the dirt off bruised flesh, or watching a reenactment. | An academy, which would be associated with Reason and allow recovery tests with Influence or Means by getting aid from a trained surgeon or banker, or spending some quiet time in the library. | A hospital, which would be associated with physical conditions and allow recovery tests with Influence or Means by acquiring medical care. | A theater, which would be associated with mental conditions and allow recovery tests with Maneuver or Craft by processing your troubles in drama. | A courthouse, which would be associated with social conditions and allow recovery tests with Influence or Fight by proving (or “proving”) your innocence. | .

Should it ever be unclear what difficulty a test is supposed to be, it will most likely be 1; you only need to achieve 1 effort to succeed. If both an environmental and an opponent’s trait would notably hinder your efforts, add their ratings together to determine the test’s difficulty. Only add the rating of 1 environmental trait and/or 1 opponent’s trait to the difficulty of an uncontested test. When multiple would apply, choose the highest or most relevant. If the difficulty of an uncontested test ever exceeds 3, consider the characters’ goals to determine if a single die roll really is the best way to resolve the situation or if a more detailed conflict would be more appropriate. Consequences . It is vital that the story is never unchanged after a skill test, so when you fail an uncontested test, at least one of a few different things which will happen. In many cases the GM will introduce an interesting narrative consequence. Either you got what you wanted at a cost or something dramatic follows your failure. Alternatively, as it is hard to come up with interesting consequences for every test, you might take a Stress equal to the difference between the test’s difficulty and the effort you achieved (choose the Type of Stress depending on the situation and how you failed). If this causes you to take a new condition, name it something appropriate to represent your exhaustion, strain, or injury from your failure. The aim is to create a solid baseline for the flow of play. Cyrene wants to enter the sultan’s city but the gates are closed and will not open before sunrise. She decides to try her luck anyway. As she approaches the gate, she winks at the younger of the two guards. The skill is obvious in this scenario, she wants to Influence the guards to let her pass. Cyrene is trained at Influence, so for her every face of a 5 or higher is a success. For her Approach, she settles on Intuition. She is going with the flow, trying to draw something out of the guards to turn to her advantage. As her rating for Intuition is 5, she will roll 5 dice. The GM decides an uncontested test will suffice to convincing the guards to let Cyrene pass. The sultan’s city has the trait Under Martial Law with a rating of 2 so the difficulty for the test is also 2. The curfew turns an otherwise trivial task into a challenge. Cyrene throws her 5 dice. Two dice come up 1 and. As she chose Intuition as her Approach, she uses her trait Charming Stranger to re-roll those 1s. Her result now is 2, 3, 4, 4, 6. All dice which come up 5+ are hits for her, so she achieved 1 effort; not enough to succeed. The guards remain untouched by her charm, though one ogles the sword at her side. She came to the city to rest not exhaust herself even more, nor is she willing to give up her sword to gain entry, so she decides against powering through and . She marks 1 XP for the 1 effort she achieved, but now she must try another way to get into the city. She could try to frighten the guards into letting her pass, but with them already looking irritated and with her Vigor rating of 3, she fears this might go poorly for her and so decides against it. Let It Ride . If you fail a test, you may not repeat the test with the same skill and attribute again until something fundamentally changes about the situation. You may attempt a different attribute but the difficulty of the test might increase. You may always change your approach and use a different skill to achieve your goal a different way. ",

When they do, everyone tests and adds their successes together to determine if they manage to succeed as a group. When two or more character use the same skill and the same attribute to achieve the same goal, they always test as a group. During uncontested tests, for each participant beyond the first, the difficulty of the test is increased by 1. Group tests can be incredible tools to achieve great deeds. They can also simply be used to help your compatriots to overcome obstacles you find trivial. But they come at the cost of increasing the risk for all participants. You either win or you fail as a group. When a group fails an uncontested test, each member of the group receives XP equal to the effort they individually mustered. A group can power through but each member of the group takes stress equal to the difference between the test’s difficulty and the effort they, individually, achieved. Outside the city, Cyrene meets up with her travel companion Maro, who comes to her with grave news. They definitely need to enter the sultan’s city tonight. Luckily, Maro remembers scaffolding at the south wall he passed by a few days ago. When they arrive fortune is on their side. Only a few guards in sight. But scaling the city wall undetected will still not be an easy task. The city wall has the trait Weathered &amp; Steep with a rating of 2, so the difficulty for the test is 2 but because of the Martial Law, there are guards on the wall Keeping Watch which increases the difficulty by 1 which is now 3 because they want to enter the city unseen. Though, they can use the Scaffolding trait with rating 1 to their advantage. Cyrene and Maro attempt to climb the wall as a group, which increases the difficulty by 1 to 4. They both test their Maneuver with Vigor (as the task will require endurance more than anything else). They both invoke the Scaffolding trait to add 1 additional die to their roll. Cyrene rolls 2 hits and so does Maro for a total of 4 effort; just enough to succeed. Alone, none of them would not have managed to scale the wall undetected, but together they prevailed, and now they are finally inside. ",

You also have access to your opponents’ detrimental traits to exploit for your advantage. Opponents’ traits . During a contest, you may invoke 1 of your opponent’s detrimental traits which is known to you by describing how you would leverage that trait to your advantage. If the group agrees that your creative efforts would result in an advantage for you, add its rating as dice to your roll. You may only invoke a single of your opponent’s detrimental traits per test. If your opponent has multiple fitting detrimental traits, you may only choose 1 of them. If you are testing against multiple opponents, you may also choose 1 trait from among all their traits. Once you have invoked an opponent’s trait during a scene, you may do so until the scene ends or the scene changes so that your previous description would no longer grant you an advantage without having to go into detail how you would leverage that trait to your advantage. You may invoke both an environmental and one of your opponent’s traits on the same roll. Cyrene tracks a ghoul through the sewers to its hiding place, where a fight erupts. Cyrene discovered the Light Sensitivity trait with rating 2 of ghouls while doing research and raises the torch in her hand as she rushes forward. Everyone at the table agrees that she can invoke the trait to her advantage, both when attacking and defending, this way, and she adds 2 die to her attack roll as she blinds the ghoul with fire. As long as she has her torch in this fight with the ghoul, she may add 2 additional die to her attack and defense rolls. Detrimental traits . When you test with a skill in a contest, you may also use your traits to your detriment. Though, in most cases, your opponent will be the one to have that idea first. Instead of increasing the difficulty, using a trait to your detriment during a contest, lets your opponent add your trait’s rating as dice to their roll. When one of your traits is used against you this way, you may spend 1 Favor to not give your opponent any dice, similarly like you would during uncontested tests. During a kerfuffle at court, Cyrene tries to embarrass one of the guests she met previously (when he crossed her during a previous adventure). She only manages 1 success on her roll, though he manages none at all, he invokes Cyrene’s Drunkard trait against her to add 1 die to his roll. Cyrene may now spend 1 Favor to not give him that additional die, but she wants to see what will happen and decides against it. The obnoxious guest manages to roll a success on his additional die and turns the outcome into a tie, which he, as the defender, wins. The court is now laughing at Cyrene, as he deflects her insults right back into her face. What a windbag. At least she received 1 XP for her Influence from her 1 success. ",
