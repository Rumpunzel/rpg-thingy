# Skill Tests

When you consult the dice, the game calls it a **Skill Test.** {{ site.title }} uses a **d6** dice pool system. So whenever the game calls for dice to be rolled, roll a handful of six-sided dice equal to the rating of the [Attribute](../characters/attributes) with which you chose to test. Each die can either be a hit or a miss, depending on if its face shows at least the training of the skill with which you chose to test.  
All hits counted together are called **Effort.** Achieving more Effort is always better.

A test has a difficulty, a number that defines how much effort it takes to succeed on the test, otherwise the test is a failure. There are no tests without consequences. No matter if you succeed on a test or fail it, you will either get what you want and/or suffer a setback. Either way, after a test both the narrative and your character make progress, either by achieving your goal or by growing with your failures.


## Group Tests

Characters may act in tandem with each other when trying to achieve the same goal while testing the same skill with the same attribute. When they do, everyone tests and adds their successes together to determine their effort.

When two or more character use the same skill with the same attribute to achieve the same goal, they always test as a group. When they do, determine the character who initiated the test. Only that character can add dice from [Traits](../characters/traits), [Boons and Banes](boons-&-banes), and use their [Disposition](../characters/attributes#disposition), the others cannot.

## Skill Tests in a Nutshell

{: .note-title }
> Skill Tests in a Nutshell
>
> - Choose a goal to achieve.
> - Describe what action you would like to undertake in the fiction.
> - Choose a skill according to your goal and described action.
> - Pick an [Attribute](../characters#attributes). If you have already described an action, try and go with the attribute most fitting your description. Otherwise, let your choice of attribute guide your roleplay.
> - Decide whether to act as a group.
> - Determine if the test will be a challenge, a contest, or a gauntlet.
> - **Roll the dice.**
> - The target number for your dice is determined by the skill you've chosen. Every face of a die that comes up as at least that number, is a hit, all others are misses.
> - Use traits for dice modifiers, extra dice, or an increases difficulty, and spend Favor.
> - Determine the outcome of the test. If you succeeded, you get what you want, otherwise mark **1** **XP** and resolve the consequences of the test.



# Consequences

It is a fundamental rule of {{ site.title }} that the world is never unchanged after a skill test. The aim if this is to create a solid baseline for the flow of play.


## Consequences of Success

When you succeed on a skill test, you get what you want and the story moves forward.


## Consequences of Failure

When you fail a skill test, you do not get what you want, though that poses the question of how the world has changed.  
In many cases the GM or another player at the table will introduce an interesting narrative consequence. Either you got what you wanted at a cost or something dramatic follows your failure.

But coming up with interesting narrative consequences to change the world is hard, so in most cases it will be your character and the condition they find themselves in which must change.

### Improving with Failure

The good part about failure is that when you fail a skill test, you mark **1** **XP** for the skill you used.  
Apart from completing goals, this is the only way to gain **XP** for your skills.

### Injury and Misfortune

The bad part is that will suffer an [Injury](injury-&-misfortune#injury) or a [Misfortune](injury-&-misfortune#misfortune) when you fail a skill test, depending on what your intent of the skill test was.

If you wanted to hurt or inflict harm, instead you suffer hurt or harm in the form of an injury. Otherwise, you suffer a misfortune (more detail on this in the following sections).



# Challenges

Challenges are the most basic form of test, when there is no other character or creature to directly or indirectly keep you from achieving your goal. Or, if there is, they are simply trying to keep you from achieving your goal without having any other goals of their own.

  <figcaption>A good ol' late-night mugging can be resolved with a single challenge.</figcaption>
</figure>

Most often challenges result from an environmental trait that would noticeably hinder your efforts. Though a character or creature with a trait that would noticeably hinder you is also not uncommon.  
In any case, the rating of the trait which hinders your efforts, sets the test's difficulty.

If both an environmental and an opponent's trait would notably hinder your efforts, choose the one with the highest rating to determine the difficulty of a challenge.

Should it ever be unclear what difficulty a test is supposed to be, it will most likely be **1;** you only need to achieve **1** effort to succeed.

If the difficulty of a challenge ever exceeds **3,** consider the characters' goals to determine if a single die roll really is the best way to resolve the situation or if a more detailed conflict in the form of a [Gauntlet](gauntlets) would be more appropriate.

> - Buying a horse


## Failing a Challenge

As mentioned above, it is vital that the world is never unchanged after a skill test, so when you fail a challenge, you suffer a minor injury (rating **1**) or a minor misfortune (rating **1**), depending on if your intent was to hurt or harm.

### Succeeding at a Cost

In many cases the GM will allow you get what you wanted after all, though at a price. To do so, increase the rating of the injury or misfortune your suffered by your margin of failure.

You may replace the injury of misfortune with a narrative consequence, the loss of one of your possessions, or any consequence which seems more fitting and/or interesting, though there will be always at least some cost.

When you decline the opportunity to succeed at a cost, you take responsibility to keep the story moving forward into a different direction.

When you succeed at a cost, you still mark **XP** as you still have technically failed the challenge.

### Let It Ride

When you fail a challenge, you may not repeat the challenge with the same skill and attribute again until something fundamentally changes about the situation. You may attempt a different attribute but the difficulty of the challenge might increase as your previous attempt might have created a new trait.

You may always change your approach or use a different skill to achieve your goal a different way.

> Cyrene wants to enter the sultan's city but the gates are closed and will not open before sunrise. She decides to try her luck anyway. As she approaches the gate, she winks at the younger of the two guards.
>
> As the gate and the guards are only passive obstacles in this scenario, convincing them to let Cyrene pass is resolved with a challenge.
> 
> The skill is obvious in this scenario, she wants to Influence the guards to let her pass. Cyrene is trained at Influence, so for her every face of a **5** or higher is a success.
>
> For her Approach, she settles on Intuition. She is going with the flow, trying to draw something out of the guards to turn to her advantage. As her rating for Intuition is **4,** she will roll **4** dice.
>
> The sultan's city has the trait `UNDER MARTIAL LAW` with a rating of **2** so the difficulty for the test is also **2.** The curfew turns an otherwise trivial task into a challenge.
>
> Cyrene throws her **4** dice. As she chose Intuition as her Approach, she spends **1** Favor and uses her trait `Charming Stranger` to re-roll those dice as she did not like the result. Her result now is **2, 4, 4, 6.** All dice which come up **5+** are hits for her, so she achieved **1** effort; not enough to succeed.
> 
> She suffers a minor misfortune from the guard responding to her attempts by first detailing his day and then his week in excruciating detail without making any motion to let her pass. The other guard remains untouched by her charm, though he ogles the sword at her side.
> 
> Cyrene might either increase the rating of the misfortune she suffered by her margin of failure from a minor to a moderate misfortune (by feigning interest in the guard's tales) or give up her sword to succeed at a cost. As she came to the city to rest not exhaust herself even more, nor to give up her sword, she decides against succeeding at cost and must find another way.
>
> In any case, she marks **1** **XP** for her efforts and is now one step closer to leveling up her Intuition as she has learned a valuable lesson. She could try to frighten the guards into letting her pass, but with them already looking irritated and with her Vigor rating of **1,** she fears this might go even worse for her and so decides against it.


## Group Challenges

During group challenges, for each participant beyond the first, the difficulty of the test is increased by **1.**

Group challenges can be incredible tools to achieve great deeds. They can also simply be used to help your compatriots to overcome obstacles you find trivial. But they come at the cost of increasing the risk for all participants. You either win or you fail as a group, as you combine your effort.

When a group fails a group challenge, each member of the group marks **1** **XP.**

When a group chooses to succeed at a cost, _each_ member of the group increased the rating of the injury or misfortune they suffered equal to the group's margin of failure. As difficulty increases with each member of a group, this can make succeeding at a cost extremely dangerous or even practically impossible.

{: .important }
> Outside the city, Cyrene meets up with her travel companion Maro, who comes to her with grave news. They definitely need to enter the sultan's city _tonight._ Luckily, Maro remembers scaffolding at the south wall he passed by a few days ago. When they arrive fortune is on their side. Only a few guards in sight. But scaling the city wall undetected will still not be an easy task.
>
> The city wall has the trait `WEATHERED AND STEEP FORTIFICATIONS` with a rating of **3,** so the difficulty for the test is **3,** though, they can use the `SCAFFOLDING` trait with rating **1** to their advantage.
>
> Cyrene and Maro attempt to climb the wall as a group, which increases the difficulty by **1** to **4.** They both test their Maneuver with Vigor (as the task will require endurance more than anything else). As Maro took the lead, he uses the `SCAFFOLDING` trait to add **1** additional die to his roll. Cyrene rolls **2** hits and so does Maro for a total of **4** effort; just enough to succeed.
>
> Alone, none of them would not have managed to scale the wall, but together they prevailed, and now they are finally inside.



# Contests

When characters oppose each other and each of them try to achieve a different goal, then the situation calls for a contest. A contest is similar to a challenge, though instead of trying to beat a difficulty, opposing characters roll against each other and try to beat the other's effort.

<figure>
  <img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2QqI8vSa9rQ/VKQ_ANDE7OI/AAAAAAAAEC4/XMvpPVWuUSU/s1600/10580257_10153055484583135_371744883842036670_n.jpg" alt="Magic Duel">
  <figcaption>A duel between mages can be resolved with a single contest.</figcaption>
</figure>

Before rolling for a contest, determine of inflicting harm on the opponent is part of the conflict. This will decide whether the consequence of losing the contest will be suffering an injury or misfortune.

The attacker, whoever initiated the contest, tests first; the achieved effort sets the difficulty of the defender. Then the defender tests to try to achieve enough effort to meet or exceed the attacker's.

If the defender fails to succeed, the attacker wins and gets what they want and the defender does not.

If the defender succeeds, they win get what they want but the attacker does not.  
On ties the defender also wins and gets what they want.

The winner also inflicts harm on the loser equal to their margin of success (on ties no harm is inflicted), either as an injury, if inflicting harm was determined to be part of the contest, or as a misfortune, if it was not.

In most cases, both the defender and the attacker test the same skill, though with the attribute of their choice. In some circumstances it might make sense to test different Skills, though those occasions will be uncommon.

## Traits during Contests

During contests, using your own traits to your detriment does not increase the difficulty for yourself but works a little differently. You also have access to your opponents' detrimental traits to exploit for your advantage.

### Detrimental Traits

When you test with a skill in a contest, you may use your traits to your detriment as you would during a challenge. Though, in most cases, your opponent will be the one to have that idea first. Instead of increasing the difficulty your opponent adds your trait's rating as dice to their roll. This counts as them using a trait to add dice to their roll, so they may not also add dice from an environmental trait.

When one of your traits is used against you this way, you gain Favor or you may spend Favor equal to the trait's rating to not give your opponent any dice, similarly like you would during challenges.

{: .important }
> During a kerfuffle at court, Cyrene tries to embarrass one of the guests she met previously (when he crossed her during a previous adventure). She only manages **1** success on her roll, though he manages none at all, he invokes Cyrene's `DRUNKARD` trait against her to add **1** die to his roll. Cyrene may now spend **1** Favor to not give him that additional die, but she wants to see what will happen and decides to gain **1** Favor instead.
>
> The obnoxious guest manages to roll a hit and turns the outcome into a tie, which he, as the defender, wins. The court is now chuckling at Cyrene, as he deflects her insults right back into her face. What a windbag. At least she received **1** Favor and **1** **XP** for her Influence.

### Opponents' Traits

During a contest, you may use **1** of your opponent's traits just as they can use yours, which is known to you by describing how you would leverage that trait to your advantage. If the group agrees that your creative efforts would result in an advantage for you, add its rating as dice to your roll.  
You may only use a single of your opponent's detrimental traits per test. If your opponent has multiple fitting detrimental traits, you may only choose **1** of them. If you are testing against multiple opponents, you may also choose **1** trait from among all their traits.

Once you have used an opponent's trait during a scene, you may do so until the scene ends or the scene changes so that your previous description would no longer grant you an advantage without having to go into detail how you would leverage that trait to your advantage.

You may only add additional dice from **1** source, so either an environmental or one of your opponent's traits, no both.

{: .important }
> Cyrene tracks a ghoul through the sewers to its hiding place, where a fight erupts. Cyrene discovered the `LIGHT SENSITIVTY` trait with rating **2** of ghouls while doing research and raises the torch in her hand as she rushes forward. Everyone at the table agrees that she can invoke the trait to her advantage, both when attacking and defending, this way, and she adds **2** dice to her attack roll as she blinds the ghoul with fire. As long as she has her torch in this fight with the ghoul, she may add **2** additional dice to her attack and defense rolls.


## Group Contests

When a group tests during contests, the target adds **1** die for each participant beyond the first. When two or more groups test against each others, for each side, the original attacker and defender add **1** die for each participant on the opposing side beyond the first (this will get incredibly dangerous very quickly).

When a group fails a contest, the opposing side inflict injury or misfortune to _each_ member of the group who lost equal to the margin of failure.

{: .note-title }
> Rulings
>
> - Sometimes there is no obvious defender for a contest. In that case, without a defender for the contest, on a tie, everyone loses. The GM may also introduce an unexpected defender to win instead in that scenario.
>
> - There may be multiple attacking teams during a contest (though there is only ever **1** defending team) but there can only ever be a single winner; the attacking team, who achieves the greatest effort wins the contest. If two or more attacking teams are tied for greatest effort, they all lose and a different attacking team (or the defending team, if they are the only one left) win instead.



# Gauntlets

In general, a contest can handle any interaction between two or more characters; disagreements, arm-wrestling, races, even fights with only one test for each side.  
And challenges handle everything else without an opposing side; athletic challenges, public speeches, travelling, and even murder.

But a single roll does not always have enough weight to justify its effect on the narrative. For those occasions, when the stakes are high and the current scene requires a more dramatic resolution, {{ site.title }} offers a more intricate resolution mechanic called a [Gauntlet](gauntlets). In essence, it is a series of contests but with a lot more room for details and casualties. They are detailed in their own chapter.
