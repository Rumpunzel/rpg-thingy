individual decision to see who comes out on top, then that calls for a conflict. A lot of the time fights with important enemies will be handled through conflicts, as will crucial chases, heated debates, and even something like a deciding competition between craftsmen or trade guilds.</p><p>A conflict is divided between at least two sides, each with their own captain, though there can be more than two teams with different goals. Each side has a captain and needs at least one character to fulfill that role but may include many more characters.</p><p>To start a conflict, establish a Goal for each side and name a captain for each side. Most of the time this will be the character who initiated the conflict and their target.<br /> All remaining characters who want to participate in the conflict either join an existing team or, if their goal differs from the established goals, form a new team with them as captain.<br /> A character may abstain from a conflict, though that means they can only witness and not influence its outcome.</p><p>Then determine the relevant <a href="/skill-list">Skill</a> for the conflict. (<a href="/skill-list#fight">Fight</a> for skirmishes; <a href="/skill-list#influence">Influence</a> for debates; <a href="/skill-list#maneuver">Maneuver</a> for chases; etc.)</p><h1 id="morale"> <a href="#morale" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="morale"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Morale</h1><p>During a conflict, each team’s capability to fight on is represented by their morale, or more specifically, the damage to their morale.

There is always at least a brief moment, sometimes even a lengthy period of time, a calm before the storm, in which sides anticipate imminent confrontation and position themselves.<br /> If characters are surprised at the start of a conflict, then only ever about <em>how</em> their opponent engaged them, maybe even <em>who exactly</em> engaged them but not ever that they were engaged at all.</p><p>Before a conflict, a team positions, either literally by forming a formation or leveraging their environment; but also figuratively, by motivating their comrades, ensuring supply lines, researching the enemy and sneaking up on them.</p><p>To position for a conflict, test a skill that is not the relevant skill and note the effort you achieved.</p><h2 id="benefits"> <a href="#benefits" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="benefits"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Benefits</h2><p>Each participant in the conflict chooses a benefit depending on their noted effort.
