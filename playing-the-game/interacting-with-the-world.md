# Interacting with the World

A lot of the time, when you want to do something in the fictional world, you simply do it. For example, if you want to stroll across the countryside and take in the sights, you simply do it.

On the other hand, if you wanted to venture deep into the dark unknown to throw the One Ring into Mount Doom, it would feel quite cheap and anticlimactic if you simply were done with it and home again by the end of your sentence.

A similar need for a dramatic resolution occurs when you want to hit a baddie with your sword, bribe a guard, or try to walk across a tightrope. It's the moment we roll the dice, the moment we relinquish total control over the fictional world of our own making so random chance may satisfy our thirst for a dramatic resolution.

When you consult the dice, the game calls it a [Skill Test](skill-tests). A skill test has a difficulty, a number that defines how complicated and/or dangerous the task is. They are discussed in more detail in their respective chapter.

We do not want to partake in victories we have not earned and only suffer insults we feel we have earned. As we cannot open an actual portal into the fictional world to climb Mount Doom ourselves, we put the burden of work on the dice in our hands that the may judge our efforts worthy...or not.

> Accordingly, if we have already put a satisfying effort into attempting our task, there is no need to roll any dice to validate it. This, of course, also depends on the task you want to accomplish.
> 
> For example, if you want to walk across the countryside, that is a simple task with little to gain should you succeed and little to lose should you not, describing the act was enough effort, hence no need to roll any dice.
> 
> Though, if you want to petition to warring kingdoms to negotiate peace, that is a lot harder task with much more at stake, though if, after you've given your speech at the table, no one would see a reason why the factions would not agree, you have put in enough work so, again, no dice need to be rolled. If, on the other hand, there still remains some doubt, roll the dice; in that case you will still be rewarded for you efforts when doing so (see [Taking Advantage of Traits](#taking-advantage-of-traits)). 



# The World as a Collection of Traits

Your character is not the only one to have traits. Other characters also have traits of their own and so does the environment itself, which you may either use them to your advantage or which may get in your way.

Like your own traits, most of these traits will have a rating between **1** and **3.**


## Environmental Traits

There are always plentiful traits on your surroundings. Finding them is the easy part, making use of them requires a varying amount of creativity, depending on the circumstances. A lot of the time environmental traits will be reason why you test a skill.

If it's a `Sunny Day`, then that is a trait on the scene, so is a `Lively Atmosphere`, `Pouring Rain`, `Thick Forest`, `Raging River`, and `Treacherous Swamps`. Most environmental traits are implied by the GM's description of the scene but some may be stated outright or created by a PC or NPC.

Unless stated otherwise by the GM, all environmental traits have a rating of **1.** Environmental traits with rating **2** and **3** exist, but they are exceedingly rare. In extraordinary cases an environmental trait may even have a rating exceeding **3.**

From the example above `Thick Forest` and `Raging River` would have a rating of **2,** and `Treacherous Swamps` would have a rating of **3.**


## Other Characters' Traits

Other characters such as NPCs and monsters also have traits of their own. Some examples include `Grumpy Merchant`, `Far-travelled Sage`, `Duke of the Realm`, `Addictive Personality`, and `Legendary Blademaster of the Iron Talon`. Just as with environmental traits, most character traits are implied by the GM's description and unless stated otherwise by the GM, have a rating of **1.** Character traits with rating **2** and **3** exist, but they are exceedingly rare. In extraordinary cases, such as a dragon's impenetrable scales, a character trait may even have a rating exceeding **3.**

From the example above `Duke of the Realm` and `Addictive Personality` would have a rating of **2,** and `Legendary Blademaster of the Iron Talon` would have a rating of **3.**



# Traits as Obstacles

Environmental and other characters' traits are the main culprits when we decide to consult the dice. When the narrative for a dramatic resolution because of the existence of one of these traits, you may make a skill test with difficulty equal to the trait's rating to resolve the current situation.

There are two different scenarios when a trait might get in your way and call for a skill test: when they either directly get in your way (see [Opposition](#opposition)) or when you try to accomplish that will be complicated because of your intentions (see [Character Goals](#character-goals)).


## Opposition

Most often you will make a skill test when another character, a creature, or the environment is opposing you.

Bribing a guard, or walking across a tightrope are all dramatic actions which call for skill tests because you face opposition in the form of a trait. The guard might have scruples about fulfilling his duty and the wind pulls at your clothes as if it wanted to drag you into the ravine.

Either a character or the scene has a trait directly opposing. As described above, that trait's rating will mark the difficulty for your test.

{: .important }
> Cyrene finds herself in front of collapsed bridge across a raging river. The GM describes how it foams with a primordial rage between her and her destination. When she asks the GM, he confirms her suspicions that the `Raging River` trait on the scene indeed has a rating of **2.** If she wants to cross it, she must first succeed on a skill test with difficulty **2.**
>
> Had the river been less ferocious, the trait describing it would have been rated lower and hence the test would have been easier. Or if there had been no river at all, then there would have been no need for a skill test.


## Character Goals

A character's goals also influence the certainty of actions. Though, a test and the corresponding dice roll in rpg thingy should always move the narrative forward. If you find yourself at the same point after a test as you did before, the test was uninteresting and should not have been made.

If you want to hit a training dummy, it simply happens, as it has no trait that might oppose you. If, on the other hand, you want to hit the training dummy to impress an onlooker, you may still hit the dummy, but as the onlooker might have a trait (such as `Lady of Castle Longlake`) which would oppose you in your attempts to impress, the situation calls for a dramatic resolution, so you consult the dice.

In gameplay terms, the difficulty of the test would be the rating of the trait `Lady of Castle Longlake`, so in this case **2.** The dummy can be completely neglected as it hardly opposes you in your attempt to impress (the result of this test would be a [Boon](boons-&-banes#using-traits)).

> Traits as Obstacles in Revue
> 
> In general, if an action has only one (interesting) outcome, it simply happens. While it is true that, at least in theory, a character could trip and fall down the stairs every time (as there is a `Staircase` trait on the scene), both walking down and falling down the stairs are absolutely uninteresting, and the `Staircase` does not get into your way when trying to achieve your goal to ascend or descend it, so the action simply happens.
> 
> In brief, if there is no ulterior goal to an action, there is plenty of time to accomplish it, there is no opposition from either the world or another character, and there are fewer than two interesting outcomes, then an action simply happens. Either you get what you want or the action is impossible, and you must find another way.



# Taking Advantage of Traits

When you test a skill, you may use **1** trait (either environmental or from another character) which is known to you by describing how you would leverage that trait to your advantage. If the group agrees that your creative efforts would result in an advantage for you, add its rating as dice to your roll.

You may only take advantage of a single trait per test. If there are multiple fitting traits, you may only choose **1** of them. If you test as a group, only one of you may take advantage of a trait.

Once you have used a trait during a scene, you may do so until the scene ends or the scene changes so that your previous description would no longer grant you an advantage without having to go into detail how you would leverage that trait to your advantage.

> Maro is infiltrating an enemy outpost in the dark of night. The group agrees that he may use the implied `Moonless Night` trait on the scene to gain **1** additional die when sneaking past the guards. As long as it remains night, he may add **1** additional die to his infiltration attempts.


## Discovering Traits

If you have a trait, you know of all obvious traits of places, creatures, or people connected to your area of expertise. You may ask the GM for this at any time, and you are invited to enrich the world with your descriptions of your character's experience any time you see fit.

{: .important }
> During their last adventure, Mare and Cyrene have crossed path with the robber king of Gantha and Maro got swept up in his character's past and now this robber king spells quite a bit of trouble. Though, as an `Exiled Sellsword of Gantha`, there is for sure something Maro knows about this robber king that might aid them in their struggle.

Depending on the rating of your trait, different kinds of information are available to you of all places, creatures, or people connected to the trait:

- **Rating 1+:** All obvious traits; their best attribute; their best skill.
- **Rating 2+:** Their lowest rated hidden trait; their worst attribute and its rating; their disposition.
- **Rating 3+:** Their highest rated hidden trait; all their attributes and skills.

{: .important }
> As Maro's trait `Exiled Sellsword of Gantha` has a rating of **2,** he knows of the robber king's best attribute is Reason and that it is quite a lot higher than Maro's at **5.**
>
> Fortunately, he also learns of the robber king's lowest rated secret trait `Hates Sunlight` which has a rating of **1.** It is not much but if he harbors such a secret, perhaps there is more hiding beneath to surface. Time to do some research (see [Research](resting#research)).


## Creating Traits

Alternatively, you may also suggest a new traits for a place, a creature, or a person connected to one of your own traits as long as the table agrees with your suggestion.

Often, the GM will like your suggestion and add the trait (or a variation of it) on their own volition with the rating of their choosing as a new trait.

If the new trait is a fitting and creative idea but would be a little _too_ convenient for your current predicament, the GM may ask you to spend **1** Favor to create the new trait on the place, creature, or person with rating up to the rating of your own trait.
Alternatively, you may create new environmental traits with skill tests (see [Creating Boons Using Traits](../playing-the-game/boons-&-banes)).
