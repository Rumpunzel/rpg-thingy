# Environmental Traits

Your character is not the only one to have traits. Others characters also have traits of their own (see [Contests](/skill-tests#contests)) and so does the environment itself, and you may use them to your advantage.

There are always plentiful traits on your surroundings. Finding them is the easy part, making use of them requires a varying amount of creativity, depending on the circumstances. If it's a `Sunny Day`, then that is a trait on the scene, so is a `Lively Atmosphere`, `Pouring Rain`, `Thick Forest`, and `Treacherous Swamps`. Most environmental traits are implied by the GM's description of the scene but some may be stated outright or created by a PC or NPC.

Unless stated otherwise by the GM, all environmental traits have a rating of **1.** traits with rating **2** and **3** exist, but they are exceedingly rare.

When you test a skill, you may invoke **1** environmental trait which is known to you by describing how you would leverage that trait to your advantage. If the group agrees that your creative efforts would result in an advantage for you, add its rating as dice to your roll.

You may only invoke a single environmental trait per test. If there are multiple fitting environmental traits, you may only choose **1** of them.

Once you have invoked an environmental trait during a scene, you may do so until the scene ends or the scene changes so that your previous description would no longer grant you an advantage without having to go into detail how you would leverage that trait to your advantage.

> Maro is infiltrating an enemy outpost in the dark of night. The group agrees that he may invoke the implied `Moonless Night` trait on the scene to gain **1** additional die when sneaking past the guards. As long as it remains night, he may add **1** additional die to his infiltration attempts.


# Discovering Traits

If you have a trait, openly known traits of places, creatures, or people connected to your area of expertise. You may ask the GM for this at any time, and you are invited to enrich the world with your descriptions of your character's experience any time you see fit.

> During their last adventure, Mare and Cyrene have crossed path with the robber king of Gantha and Maro got swept up in his character's past and now this robber king spells quite a bit of trouble. Though, as an `Exiled Sellsword of Gantha`, there is for sure something Maro knows about this robber king that might aid them in their struggle.

Depending on the rating of your trait, different kinds of information are available to you of all places, creatures, or people connected to the trait:

- **Rating 1+:** All obvious traits; their best attribute and how it compares to your own (about equal, lesser, greater, less than half, or more than double); their three best skills and if they are better trained than you, equal, or worse.
- **Rating 2+:** Their lowest rated hidden trait; their worst attribute; their disposition.
- **Rating 3+:** Their highest rated hidden trait; all their attributes and skills.

> As Maro's trait `Exiled Sellsword of Gantha` has a rating of **2,** he knows of the robber king's best attribute is Reason and that it is quite a lot higher than Maro's.
>
> Fortunately, he also learns of the robber king's lowest rated secret trait `Only goes out at Night` which has a rating of **1.** It is not much but if he harbors such a secret, perhaps there is more hiding beneath to surface. Time to do some research (see [Research](resting#research)).


## Creating Traits

Alternatively, you may also suggest a new traits for a place, a creature, or a person connected to one of your own traits as long as the table agrees with your suggestion.

Often, the GM will like your suggestion and add the trait (or a variation of it) on their own volition with the rating of their choosing as a new trait.

Alternatively, if the new trait is a fitting and creative idea but would be a little _too_ convenient for your current predicament, the GM may ask you to spend **1** Favor to create the new trait on the place, creature, or person with rating up to the rating of your own trait.
