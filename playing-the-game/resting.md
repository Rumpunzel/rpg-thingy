# Resting

To rest, either test [Resources](../characters/skills#resources) for [Downtime](#downtime) if you are in a settlement, or test [Wilderness](../characters/skills#wilderness) to [Make Camp](#making-camp) if are beyond the borders of civilization.

Anyone resting with you may also test the appropriate [Skill](../characters#skills). Everyone, who has chosen the same skill and attribute, [tests as a group](skill-tests/index.md#group-tests). If you are resting in a town, you will most likely get bonus dice for your rest roll (see [Supply Rating](../running-the-game/settlements.md#supply-ratings)).

You may use [Assets](assets) as usual, especially rations.

You gain a number of [Paraphernalia](assets#paraphernalia) equal to the effort you achieve during the resting test. They symbolize the means you have at your disposal and the time you have available for this rest before your shelter is exposed, before your allocated supplies run out and your rest ends.  
You may share paraphernalia with anyone else you are resting with as you please.

Depending on the attribute you tested with, the paraphernalia will be of a different type.

|                 Vigor                 |               Intuition               |                  Reason                   |
|:-------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------:|
| [Sturdy](assets#sturdy) paraphernalia | [Supple](assets#supple) paraphernalia | [Precious](assets#precious) paraphernalia |

When you attempt a skill test while resting, you must spend paraphernalia equal to the test's difficultly to attempt it. If you do not have enough paraphernalia, you cannot attempt it.  
Most tests may use any type of material but some tests such as [Crafting](assets#crafting-assets) require specific paraphernalia.

You may end a rest at any point. Any unspent paraphernalia you have at the end of a rest are lost.

While resting, you have access to a number of special skill tests.


## Crafting

You may create new asset and improve assets you already own as detailed in [Crafting Assets](assets#crafting-assets) in the chapter about assets.


## Recovering

You may mend physical and mental wounds afflicting you or someone resting with you.

You can mitigate a major wound to a moderate wound by succeeding on a difficulty **3** test. When you succeed, clear the **3** stress box in the wound's slot and rename the wound to reflect its mitigated severity.

You can mitigate a moderate wound to a minor wound by succeeding on a difficulty **2** test. When you succeed, clear both **2** stress boxes in the wound's slot and rename the wound to reflect its mitigated severity.

You can mend a minor wound by succeeding on a difficulty **1** test. When you succeed, clear all **1** stress box in the wound's slot and remove the wound from its slot.

Mending one of your own wounds increases the difficulty of the test by **1.**

If you all your wound slots are empty, you may spend paraphernalia to gain a `Well Rested` enduring [Boon](boons-&-banes#boons). This boon lasts across scenes, until it vanishes, or until you rest again, whichever happens first.

| `Well Rested` Boon Rating | Paraphernalia Required |
|:-------------------------:|:----------------------:|
|           **1**           |           1            |
|           **2**           |           3            |
|           **3**           |           6            |
|           **4**           |           10           |
|           **5**           |           15           |
|          **...**          |          ...           |


## Practice

You may practice one of your skills while resting by testing that skill and potentially gain **XP** for that skill.

The difficulty for the test is equal to half your current level in the skill, rounded down, plus the amount of **XP** needed to level it up. So if you want to train Wilderness, are already level **3** in it and have marked **7** **XP,** the difficulty for the training test to gain **1** **XP** is **4** (**1** from your current level plus **3** from missing **XP**).  
If you have no **XP** marked and/or are already highly trained in a skill, practicing becomes practically impossible.  
You may invoke a trait of an instruction manual you possess, of a training area you have access to, or of a tutor for this test.

If you succeed on the test, you mark **1** **XP** for the skill. Otherwise, you do not, but you also do not suffer any other negative consequences.

As with any test, you may also test as a group, though only one of you will gain **XP.**

## Weather-Watching

While resting, you may increase or decrease the rating of the current weather trait by **1,** or alter the name of the current weather trait (within reason).  
To do so, test Wilderness with Intuition. The difficulty for the test is the rating of the current weather trait. If you fail, the GM may increase or decrease the rating of the current weather trade or rename it to introduce a complication.

You may watch the weather any number of times per rest.



# Making Camp

While resting in the wilderness, you have access to some additional, special skill tests.


## Foraging

You may forage in the wild by testing Wilderness. Choose a difficulty for the foraging test.



# Downtime

While resting a settlement, you have access to some additional, special skill tests.


## Recovering in Settlements

While resting in a settlement, you may mend social wounds afflicting you or someone resting with you (just like you would physical or mental wounds).


## Buying

You may buy assets in settlements by testing Resources. Choose a quality rating for the asset you would like to buy. Not all quality rating may be available everywhere, often quality rating above a town's [Supply Rating](../running-the-game/settlements#supply-ratings) cannot be found.

If you succeed, you gain the asset with the chosen quality rating. Otherwise, if you achieved at least **1** effort, you gain an asset with rating **1.**

| Quality Rating | Difficulty |
|:--------------:|:----------:|
|     **1**      |     1      |
|     **2**      |     3      |
|     **3**      |     5      |
|     **4**      |     7      |
|     **5**      |     9      |
|    **...**     |    ...     |


## Selling

You may sell an asset you own by testing Resources. Discard any hits exceeding the asset's quality rating. The achieved effort is the offer you get in your current rest location. You may accept that offer or decline it. Either way, the paraphernalia to attempt to sell the asset are spent.  
If you accept, you gain a `Currency` asset for Resources of the local currency with rating equal to the effort you achieved and lose the chosen asset.


## Working

You may spend your time working while resting in a settlement. Choose a skill and a difficulty for your work (not all type of work may be available everywhere).

If you succeed, you gain a `Currency` asset for Resources of the local currency with rating equal to the chosen difficulty. Otherwise, if you achieved at least **1** effort, you gain a `Currency` asset with rating **1.**


## Research

You may spend your time brawling in taverns, visiting shady meetings, or among scrolls and tomes to learn more about a specific subject and its traits. Name the place, creature, or person you would like to know more about and test Resources. For each of your subject's hidden traits you already know, add **1** additional dice to your roll.

You learn of your subject's highest rated, hidden trait you do not already know with rating equal to or less the effort you achieved on your test. If your effort is greater than the subject's highest rated hidden trait, you also learn that you know everything there is to know about your subject.  
A research roll may result in no new information if you do not achieve enough effort.

Depending on what subject you would like to research, a different attribute is required.
