# Boons & Banes

When you want to create an advantage for yourself or an ally, or hinder an opponent, you may create a boon to aid or a bane to hinder.

Boons and banes are temporary traits, which are one-use only. They may be used on any test where it would make sense that they would help or hinder.

In general, boons and banes can only be utilized with the same attribute with which they were created. Though, if it makes sense in the narrative, you may use them with other attributes as well.


## Creating Boons & Banes

Most boons and banes are created during [Gauntlets](gauntlets#gaining-an-advantage), though you can create them outside of gauntlets as well.

You may increase the difficulty of a test (even if the difficulty is **0** i.e. you would not have rolled a skill test normally) by the rating of an additional trait.

When you do, and you succeed on the skill test, in addition to succeeding, you create a boon or bane with rating equal to test's difficulty, which may only be used in the context of the additional trait you chose (only on tests where the trait either helps or hinders you).

Should you not succeed on the test, not only will you not get what you want, but also, at the GM's discretion, instead of creating a boon a bane is created on you (and instead of a bane a boon is created) with rating equal to your margin of failure.

You may also turn excess effort after you have succeeded on a test into a boon on yourself; or, if you succeeded in a contest, into a bane on your opponent, by spending **1** Favour.

You may also improve a boon or bane by the excess effort you achieved when creating it by spending **1** Favour.  

Boons and banes last for as long as it makes sense or the scene ends.

Whenever you would create a boon or bane, you may create a new environmental trait with equal rating instead, if it makes sense. Note that while you may decide who may take advantage of the banes and boons you create, a trait created by you may be used by anyone in the scene like any other trait. Also, you may not create traits on yourself or other characters.

> Cyrene wants to hide and sneak behind enemy lines to deliver a threat to their general. The camp is well guarded and there are `GUARDS PATROLLING EVERYWHERE`; they are expecting unwanted visitors.
> 
> As she is a simple messenger, she could ask to be taken to the general, but she wants to meat him on her own terms and sneak into the camp instead. The difficulty to sneak into the camp at **2** because of the `GUARDS PATROLLING EVERYWHERE` trait. Cyrene tests Maneuver with Reason as she steps from shadow to shadow and succeeds. She creates a boon named `ONE WITH THE SHADOWS` with rating **2** on herself.


## Boons

When you use a boon, add dice equal to the boon's rating to your roll. Though, after you do, the boon is used up and vanishes.

If you have multiple boons which might aid you, you have to choose only one of them.

You may only gain additional dice once per roll, so either from a trait, boon, or bane. If you have multiple options, choose only one of them.

> In the enemy camp, Cyrene finds the general in his tent meditating. She steps from the shadows and delivers her message with the utmost intent to intimidate him into accepting peace negotiations. The general's `DEVOTED SERVANT OF THE EMPIRE` trait sets the difficulty of the test at **2.** Though, the GM argues that the `FORTIFIED CAMP` trait increases the difficulty to a total of **3.**
>
> Cyrene's tests Influence with Vigor and her initial roll shows only **1** success, as her Vigor is not very high, but she may now invoke her Boon `ONE WITH THE SHADOWS` to gain **2** extra dice for her intimidation attempt. The **2** extra dice turn her attempt into a success. The boon has been used and vanishes and so does Cyrene into the night, with a smile on her face.


## Banes

Banes are temporary detrimental [Traits](../characters/traits), though banes, are one-use only. After a bane increased the difficulty of a test or was used by an opponent to get extra dice, it vanishes.

If an opponent has multiple banes which you might use to aid you, you have to choose only one of them.

If you are affected by a bane, your opponent's may use it to add dice to their rolls during contests. During simple tests, add your highest rated bane's rating, which would logically hinder you, to the test's difficulty.

You may only gain additional dice once per roll, so either from a trait, boon, or bane. If you have multiple options, choose only one of them.


## Enduring Boons & Banes

Sometimes either extremely powerful effects like magic or narrative reasons might create boons or banes that endure for longer than but a moment.

An enduring boon or bane degrades by **1** rating when it is used (instead of vanishing like normal boon would). When an enduring boon or bane reaches a rating of **0,** it vanishes.

Enduring boons and banes may exist beyond the context of a single gauntlet or scene, if it makes narrative sense.

> Cyrene and Maro have snuck into a sleeping dragon's hoard to recover a long-lost artifact. The GM makes it quite clear that any test they fail while searching for the artifact will draw the attention of the dragon, though, thankfully, the dragon is asleep. To represent this, it has an enduring bane called `Caught in a Deep Slumber` with a rating of **3.**
>
> Maro starts climbing the hoard of gold with a Maneuver test but the dice forsake him, and he achieves **0** effort. He uses the `Caught in a Deep Slumber` bane and adds **3** extra dice to his roll, turning it into a success, though the `Caught in a Deep Slumber` bane degrades to a rating of **2** as a result. The dragon grunts in his sleep, one eye almost opens but Maro remains unnoticed. The two of them have some breathing room before the dragon wakes. For now.


## Extraordinary Boons & Banes

Boons and banes with extraordinary high ratings may let you add free dice to your roll without using up the boon and without it vanishing (similar to [Masterpiece Assets](assets#masterpieces)).

An extraordinary enduring boon or bane only degrades whenever a normal boon or bane would vanish, so not when you use its free dice.

| Boon Rating | Free Dice |
|:-----------:|:---------:|
|    **1**    |     -     |
|    **2**    |     -     |
|    **3**    |     1     |
|    **4**    |     1     |
|    **5**    |     2     |
|    **6**    |     2     |
|    **7**    |     3     |
|   **...**   |    ...    |
