# Skill Tests

If you want to hit a baddie with your sword, bribe a guard, or try to walk across a tightrope, we might have a rough idea what is more likely to happen, but we cannot know for certain. It's the moment we roll the dice to open a fleeting portal to the fictional world, so it may answer our questions.

When you consult the dice, the game calls it a **Skill Test.** rpg-thingy uses a **d6** dice pool system. So whenever the game calls for dice to be rolled, roll a handful of six-sided dice. Each die can either be a hit or a miss, depending on if its face shows at least a certain number. All hits counted together are called **Effort.** Achieving more Effort is always better.

A test has a difficulty, a number that defines how much Effort it takes to succeed on the test, otherwise the test is a failure. There are no tests without consequences. No matter if you succeed on a test or fail it, you will either get what you want or suffer a setback. Either way, after a test both the narrative and your character make progress, either by achieving your goal or by growing with your failures.

As mentioned above, the dice are consulted when the outcome of an action is uncertain. [Skill Tests]() and the [Certainty of Actions](#certainty-of-actions) are discussed in more detail in their respective chapter.

# Certainty of Actions

As mentioned previously, the dice are only consulted when the outcome of an action is not certain. When asking _"Is the outcome of this action certain?",_ the answer is found in three different places: opposition, character's goal, and potential outcomes.

In brief, if there is no ulterior goal to an action, there is plenty of time to accomplish it, there is no opposition from either the world or another character, and there are fewer than two interesting outcomes, then an action is certain. Either you get what you want or the action is impossible, and you must find another way.


## Opposition

Most often an action is uncertain because either another character, a creature, or the environment is opposing you.

Hitting a baddie with your sword, bribing a guard, or walking across a tightrope are uncertain actions because you face opposition. The baddie does not want to be stabbed, the guard has a duty to fulfill, and the wind pulls at your clothes as if it wanted to drag you into the ravine.

Most of the time this means either a character or the scene has a trait making the action you are trying to undertake uncertain. As described below, that trait's rating will mark the difficulty for your test.

On the other hand, if the baddie you want to hit with your sword is unconscious, asleep, or otherwise incapacitated, he cannot actively oppose your attempt to stab him and hence, there is no need to consult the dice; it is certain that you will hit.

If it has been established that the guard you want to bribe is crooked, no roll is needed if the bribe is sufficient, as the guard has no qualms which would oppose your attempted bribe. Of course, if you do not know if the bribe is sufficient, or you do not know if you can spare the expense, consult the dice.

[Assets](assets) also can make otherwise uncertain actions certain. Crossing a gaping ravine becomes quite a lot simpler if there is a bridge across it. If it has not been maintained for a long time, though, the dice await.


## Character Goals

A character's goals also influence the certainty of actions. If you want to hit the training dummy to impress an onlooker, it may be certain that you will hit the dummy, but it is uncertain if the onlooker will be impressed, so you consult the dice.

Stabbing a sleeping guard might be doable with certainty but doing so without alerting any of his fellow guards is by no means a certain task.


## Potential Outcomes

Most importantly, if an action has only one (interesting) outcome, it is certain.  While it is true that, at least in theory, a character could trip and fall down the stairs every time, both walking down and falling down the stairs are absolutely uninteresting, so the action is certain and simply happens.

A test and the corresponding dice roll in rpg thingy should always move the narrative forward. If you find yourself at the same point after a test as you did before, the test was uninteresting and should not have been made.



# Improving with Failure

When you fail a skill test, you do not get what you want, but you mark **XP** for the skill you used equal to the number of hits you rolled on that test (not the amount of effort you achieved, so using assets cannot gain you additional **XP**).  
Apart from completing goals, this is the only way go gain **XP** for your skills, though using your own traits to increase a test's difficulty can result in more **XP** than you would get normally.



# Simple Tests

Simple tests are the most basic form of test. A test is simple when there is no other character or creature to directly or indirectly keep you from achieving your goal, or they are simply trying to keep you from achieving your goal without having any other goals of their own.

# Contests

When another character, creature, or even multiple not only want to keep you from achieving your goal but have a goal of their own; or when you want to keep them from achieving their goal, the action is resolved in a contest.

# Conflicts

In general, a contest can handle any interaction between two or more characters; disagreements, arm-wrestling, races, even fights with only one test for each side.  
And simple tests handle everything else without an opposing side; athletic challenges, public speeches, travelling, and even murder.  
But a single roll does not always have enough weight to justify its effect on the narrative. For those occasions, when the stakes are high and the current scene requires a more dramatic resolution, rpg-thingy offers a more intricate resolution mechanic called a [Conflict](conflicts). In essence, it is a series of contests but with a lot more room for details and casualties. They are detailed in their own chapter.

Contests work especially well for important fights, long-winded chases, heartfelt debates, and even continent-spanning journeys.



# Resolving Tests in Revue

- Choose a goal to achieve.
- Describe what action you would like to undertake in the fiction.
- Choose a skill according to your goal and described action.
- Pick an [Attribute](../../characters#attributes). If you have already described an action, try and go with the Attribute most fitting your description. Otherwise, let your choice of Attribute guide your roleplay.
- Determine if the test will be simple, a contest, or a conflict.
- **Roll the dice.**
- The target number for your dice is determined by the skill you've chosen. Every face of a die that comes up as at least that number, is a hit, all others are misses.
- Invoke traits, use traits to you detriment, and spend Favor.
- Determine the outcome of the test. If you succeeded, you get what you want, otherwise mark **XP** equal to the number of hits you rolled.
