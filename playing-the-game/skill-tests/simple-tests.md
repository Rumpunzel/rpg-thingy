# Simple Tests

As mentioned above, most often simple tests result from an environmental trait that would noticeably hinder your effort or a character or creature with a trait that would noticeably hinder your effort opposing you. The trait's rating is the test's difficulty.

Should it ever be unclear what difficulty a test is supposed to be, it will most likely be **1;** you only need to achieve **1** effort to succeed.

If both an environmental and an opponent's trait would notably hinder your efforts, add their ratings together to determine the test's difficulty.  
Only add the rating of **1** environmental trait and/or **1** opponent's trait to the difficulty of a simple test. When multiple would apply, choose the highest or most relevant.

If the difficulty of a simple test ever exceeds **3,** consider the characters' goals to determine if a single die roll really is the best way to resolve the situation or if a more detailed conflict in the form of a [Gauntlet](../gauntlets) would be more appropriate.


## Consequences

It is vital that the story is never unchanged after a skill test, so when you fail a simple test, at least one of a few different things which will happen.

In many cases the GM will introduce an interesting narrative consequence. Either you got what you wanted at a cost or something dramatic follows your failure.

Alternatively, as it is hard to come up with interesting consequences for every test, you might take a [Stress](../../characters/wounds#stress) equal to the difference between the test's difficulty and the effort you achieved (choose the [Type of Stress](../../characters#wounds#wound-types) depending on the situation and how you failed).  
If this causes you to take a new wound, name it something appropriate to represent your exhaustion, strain, or injury from your failure.

The aim is to create a solid baseline for the flow of play.

> Cyrene wants to enter the sultan's city but the gates are closed and will not open before sunrise. She decides to try her luck anyway. As she approaches the gate, she winks at the younger of the two guards.
>
> The skill is obvious in this scenario, she wants to Influence the guards to let her pass. Cyrene is trained at Influence, so for her every face of a **5** or higher is a success.
>
> For her Approach, she settles on Intuition. She is going with the flow, trying to draw something out of the guards to turn to her advantage. As her rating for Intuition is **5,** she will roll **5** dice.
>
> The GM decides a simple test will suffice to convincing the guards to let Cyrene pass.
>
> The sultan's city has the trait `UNDER MARTIAL LAW` with a rating of **2** so the difficulty for the test is also **2.** The curfew turns an otherwise trivial task into a challenge.
>
> Cyrene throws her **5** dice. Two dice come up **1** and. As she chose Intuition as her Approach, she uses her trait `Charming Stranger` to re-roll those **1s.** Her result now is **2, 3, 4, 4, 6.** All dice which come up **5+** are hits for her, so she achieved **1** effort; not enough to succeed. The guards remain untouched by her charm, though one ogles the sword at her side. She came to the city to rest not exhaust herself even more, nor is she willing to give up her sword to gain entry, so she decides against powering through and .

> She marks **1** **XP,** but now she must try another way to get into the city. She could try to frighten the guards into letting her pass, but with them already looking irritated and with her Vigor rating of **3,** she fears this might go poorly for her and so decides against it.


## Let It Ride

If you fail a test, you may not repeat the test with the same skill and attribute again until something fundamentally changes about the situation. You may attempt a different attribute but the difficulty of the test might increase.

You may always change your approach and use a different skill to achieve your goal a different way.


## Group Tests

Characters may act in tandem with each other when trying to achieve the same goal while testing the same skill (they may use different attributes, though most of the time, they will also use the same attributes). When they do, everyone tests and adds their successes together to determine if they manage to succeed as a group.

When two or more character use the same skill and the same attribute to achieve the same goal, they always test as a group. When they do, choose one charcter who is the main actor. Only that character can add dice from [Traits](../../characters/traits) [Boons and Banes](../boons-&-banes) and use their [Disposition](../../characters/attributes#disposition).

During simple tests, for each participant beyond the first, the difficulty of the test is increased by **1.**

Group tests can be incredible tools to achieve great deeds. They can also simply be used to help your compatriots to overcome obstacles you find trivial. But they come at the cost of increasing the risk for all participants. You either win or you fail as a group.

When a group fails a simple test, each member of the group receives **1** **XP.**

When a group suffers stress, _each_ member of the group takes stress equal to the difference between the test's difficulty and the effort they, individually, achieved. As difficulty increases with each member of a group, this can result in drastic setbacks.

> Outside the city, Cyrene meets up with her travel companion Maro, who comes to her with grave news. They definitely need to enter the sultan's city _tonight._ Luckily, Maro remembers scaffolding at the south wall he passed by a few days ago. When they arrive fortune is on their side. Only a few guards in sight. But scaling the city wall undetected will still not be an easy task.
>
> The city wall has the trait `WEATHERED AND STEEP FORTIFICATIONS` with a rating of **2,** so the difficulty for the test is **2** but because of the `UNDER MARTIAL LAW`, there are `GUARDS PATROLLING THE WALLS`, though that trait only has rating **1** which increases the difficulty to **3** because they want to enter the city unseen.
>
> Though, they can use the `SCAFFOLDING` trait with rating **1** to their advantage.
> 
> Cyrene and Maro attempt to climb the wall as a group, which increases the difficulty by **1** to **4.** They both test their Maneuver with Vigor (as the task will require endurance more than anything else). They both use the `SCAFFOLDING` trait to add **1** additional die to their roll. Cyrene rolls **2** hits and so does Maro for a total of **4** effort; just enough to succeed.
> 
> Alone, none of them would not have managed to scale the wall undetected, but together they prevailed, and now they are finally inside.
