# Contests

The attacker makes a test; the achieved effort sets the difficulty of the contest for the defender. Then, the defender tests to try to achieve enough effort.

If the attacker succeeds, they get what they want but the defender does not. The attacker also inflicts stress of the type of their choosing (as long as it makes sense) on the defender equal to the difference in effort.

If the attacker fails, they do not get what they want but the defender does. The defender also inflicts stress of the type of their choosing (as long as it makes sense) on the attacker equal to the difference in effort.

On ties the defender wins but without inflicting stress.


## Traits during Contests

During contests, using your own traits to your detriment does not increase the difficulty for yourself but works a little differently. You also have access to your opponents' detrimental traits to exploit for your advantage.

### Opponents' traits

During a contest, you may invoke **1** of your opponent's detrimental traits which is known to you by describing how you would leverage that trait to your advantage. If the group agrees that your creative efforts would result in an advantage for you, add its rating as dice to your roll.  
You may only invoke a single of your opponent's detrimental traits per test. If your opponent has multiple fitting detrimental traits, you may only choose **1** of them. If you are testing against multiple opponents, you may also choose **1** trait from among all their traits.

Once you have invoked an opponent's trait during a scene, you may do so until the scene ends or the scene changes so that your previous description would no longer grant you an advantage without having to go into detail how you would leverage that trait to your advantage.

You may invoke both an environmental _and_ one of your opponent's traits on the same roll.

> Cyrene tracks a ghoul through the sewers to its hiding place, where a fight erupts. Cyrene discovered the `Light Sensitivity` trait with rating **2** of ghouls while doing research and raises the torch in her hand as she rushes forward. Everyone at the table agrees that she can invoke the trait to her advantage, both when attacking and defending, this way, and she adds **2** die to her attack roll as she blinds the ghoul with fire. As long as she has her torch in this fight with the ghoul, she may add **2** additional die to her attack and defense rolls.

### Detrimental traits

When you test with a skill in a contest, you may also use your traits to your detriment. Though, in most cases, your opponent will be the one to have that idea first. Instead of increasing the difficulty, using a trait to your detriment during a contest, lets your opponent add your trait's rating as dice to their roll.

When one of your traits is used against you this way, you may spend **1** Favor to not give your opponent any dice, similarly like you would during simple tests.

> During a kerfuffle at court, Cyrene tries to embarrass one of the guests she met previously (when he crossed her during a previous adventure). She only manages **1** success on her roll, though he manages none at all, he invokes Cyrene's `Drunkard` trait against her to add **1** die to his roll. Cyrene may now spend **1** Favor to not give him that additional die, but she wants to see what will happen and decides against it.

> The obnoxious guest manages to roll a success on his additional die and turns the outcome into a tie, which he, as the defender, wins. The court is now laughing at Cyrene, as he deflects her insults right back into her face. What a windbag. At least she received **1** **XP** for her Influence from her **1** success.


## Group Contests

When a group tests during contests, the opposing side of the group adds **1** die for each participant beyond the first. When two or more groups test against each others, each side adds **1** die for each participant on the opposing side beyond the first (this will get incredibly dangerous very quickly).

When a group fails a contest, the opposing side inflict stress to _each_ member of the group who lost equal to the difference between the opposing side's effort and the effort each member of the group individually mustered.


## Rulings

In most cases, both the defender and the attacker test the same skill, though with the attribute of their choice. In some circumstances it might make sense to test different Skills, though those occasions will be uncommon.

Sometimes there is no obvious defender for a contest. In that case, without defender for the contest, on a tie, everyone loses. The GM may also introduce an unexpected defender to win instead in that scenario.

There may be multiple attacking teams during a contest (though there is only ever **1** defending team) but there can only ever be a single winner; the attacking team, who achieves the greatest effort wins the conflict. If two or more attacking teams are tied for greatest effort, they all lose and a different attacking team (or the defending team, if they are the only one left) win instead.
