# Injury & Misfortune

Setbacks are unavoidable — expected even — during your daring adventures. These setbacks fall into two distinct categories: [Injury](#injury) and [Misfortune](#misfortune).


## Misfortune

Misfortunes are temporary, negative consequences of your attempts to overcome obstacles and influence th world. They will get in your way and, with time, fester if not looked after. And worst of all, they will help the blackguards who cross your path until you get rid of them.

Misfortunes encompass exhaustion from excessive travelling; weariness of the mind, a biting insult to your character, and exhaustion from excessive research, and so are fear and confusion; societal rejection, the result of a successful slander campaign, seclusion (willing or otherwise) from larger society, and being covered in muck.

Your character can be plagued by up to one misfortune. Whenever you fail to succeed on a [Challenge](skill-tests#challenges), you suffer a minor misfortune.  
You also suffer misfortunes as the result of contests if your opponent main goal was something other than directly hurting you.

### Misfortune Severity

You have **6** misfortune boxes that you can mark to absorb misfortunes you suffer. Each box has a corresponding number which denotes what kind of misfortune that box can absorb when you mark it.

You have **3** boxes which may absorb a minor misfortune (rating **1**) each, **2** boxes which may absorb a moderate misfortune (rating **2**) each, and **1** box which may absorb a major misfortune (rating **3**).  
You may absorb minor misfortunes in any box which may absorb a moderate misfortune, and you may absorb moderate misfortunes in the box which can absorb major misfortunes.

Whenever you suffer a misfortune, mark an empty box, noting that it absorbed that misfortune. Misfortunes you suffer must be entirely absorbed by a single box, you may not distribute a misfortune between boxes.

The severity of your misfortune is equal to your highest rating, marked misfortune box. If you do not have marked any, you do not suffer from a misfortune.

### The Injury of Adventure

Should you not have an empty box to fully absorb stress you suffered, instead mark the highest rated box you have and suffer the difference, which that box could not absorb, as an injury.

### Effect of Misfortune

If you suffer from a misfortune, you have a misfortune trait with rating equal to your misfortune's severity. Name this trait something appropriate considering the struggles and setbacks you have endured and with a negative connotation, so that it will [get in your way](../characters/traits#using-your-traits-to-your-detriment) and can be used against you during [Contest](skill-tests#detrimental-traits).

See how to recover from your misfortune in the chapter about [Resting](resting#recovering).


## Injury

Injuries encompass physical trauma and bodily injury, a cut from a blade is a physical wound, sickness, and poisoning; mental trauma, spiritual injury, terror, and confusion; and debts and severe injuries to your reputation such as being accused of treason.

Just like misfortunes, injuries have a rating associated with them, though you gain injuries only as a result of being attacked during [Gauntlets](gauntlets) (or sometimes Contests) with the explicit goal of hurting you. And, just like misfortunes, your character can be plagued by up to one injury.

### Injury Severity

You have **3** injury boxes that you can mark to absorb injuries you suffer. Each box has a corresponding number which denotes what kind of injury that box can absorb when you mark it.

You have **1** box which may absorb a minor injury (rating **1**), **1** box which may absorb a moderate injury (rating **2**), and **1** box which may absorb a major injury (rating **3**).  
You may absorb minor injuries in any box which may absorb a moderate injury, and you may absorb moderate injuries in the box which can absorb major injuries.

Whenever you suffer an injury, mark an empty box, noting that it absorbed that injury. Injuries you suffer must be entirely absorbed by a single box, you may not distribute an injury between boxes.

The severity of your injury is equal to your highest rating, marked injury box. If you do not have marked any, you do not suffer from an injury.

### Effect of Injury

Challenges always have a minimum difficulty equal to your injury's severity. If an uncontested test already has a higher difficulty, your injury do not increase it.

Sometimes your injury will have you make a test where normally no test would have been necessary. In that case, you gain **1** Favor for your trouble.

During contests, your opponents may use your injury to their advantage. Your opponent's minimum effort, when testing against you, is equal to your injury's severity.  
You may use your opponents' injuries against them for minimum effort in the same way as your opponent's can use yours against you.

See how to recover from your injury in the chapter about [Resting](resting#recovering).

### The Door of Death

Should you ever not have an empty box to fully absorb an injury, you are in deep trouble.

Calculate the difference between the rating of your highest rated, empty injury box and the injury you suffered. If you have a trait with at least that rating, you may spend Favor equal to the difference and mark that empty box. Replace the chosen trait with a new trait representing permanent damage as a result of the injury you suffered and escaped by a hair's breadth.

Otherwise, if you do not have such a trait or do not have enough Favor, the injury tears your characters from your grasp, and you must retire your character. Be it blood loss, drowning, permanent imprisonment, succumbing to sickness, execution, madness, or complete social ostracism, their journey is at an end.
