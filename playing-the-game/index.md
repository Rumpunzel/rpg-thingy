# Playing the Game

PCs exist in a fictional world in which they act, struggle, and succeed. The players' role is to bring their PC to life and the GM's responsibility is to breath life into the rest of this fictional world with descriptions, challenges, and Non-Player Characters (**NPCs**).

The PCs interact with the situation and the world presented by the GM by asking questions and narrating what they would like their characters to accomplish and how they would like to do so until the outcome of an action is no longer certain and the group consults the dice (see [Certainty of Actions](interacting-with-the-world#certainty-of-actions) and [Skill Tests](skill-tests)).
