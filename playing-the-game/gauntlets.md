# Gauntlets

When the stakes are high, and you want to circle in on each individual decision to see who comes out on top, then that calls for a gauntlet. A lot of the time fights with important enemies will be handled through gauntlets, as will crucial chases, heated debates, continent-spanning journeys, and even something like a deciding competition between craftsmen or trade guilds.

A gauntlet is essentially a sequence of [Contests](skill-tests#contests).


## Entering a Gauntlet

To enter a gauntlet, establish a goal. Choose a captain for your goal. Usually that will be the character who initiated the confrontation in the narrative.

All remaining characters who want to participate in the gauntlet either join an existing team or, if their goal differs from the established goals, form a new team with them as captain.  
A character may abstain from a gauntlet, though that means they can only witness and not influence its outcome.

Then determine the [Type of Gauntlet](#types-of-gauntlets) you are about to enter and the relevant [Skill](../characters/skills) for the gauntlet. ([Fight](../characters/skills#fight) for skirmishes; [Influence](../characters/skills#influence) for debates; [Maneuver](../characters/skills#maneuver) for chases; etc.)


## Deciding a Gauntlet

When all members of a team have surrendered or are otherwise no longer able to act, they lose the gauntlet and do not achieve their goal.

When only one team remains, they win the gauntlet and achieve their goal.

Should all teams lose the gauntlet, it spells catastrophic disaster. Depending on the narrative, all teams might achieve their goals or none at all.  
A battle might leave the countryside in ruins with neither party having achieved their objective; the plotting of two rival underground factions might drive them both to ruin as they assure their mutual destruction; a heated debate between the king and his advisor about succession rights might end in them finding understanding for each other, leaving their disputes behind, and deciding on a third solution.  
When in doubt, settle for a compromise without any winners.



# Types of Gauntlets

During any gauntlet, whenever you fail to succeed on a skill test, which is not a test to defend, you suffer a misfortune, as you would on any other test.  
The consequence of failing to defend depends on the type of gauntlet.

There are three different types of gauntlets you may enter, depending on the situation in which you find yourself, on what you are trying to achieve, and on who or what opposes you in your attempts to achieve it.


## Gauntlet of Destruction

This is the most straight-forward, most dangerous, but also the least common type of gauntlet. You are trying to destroy your opponent, and they are trying to destroy you, be that killing them in battle, devastating them mentally, or ruining them financially.  
If at least one side has a different goal than to destroy the other, choose a [Gauntlet of Contention](#gauntlet-of-contention) instead.

During a gauntlet of destruction, when a character fails to defend, their attacker inflicts an [Injury](injury-&-misfortune#injury) with rating equal to their margin of success to the defender.

Teams take turns until only one side remains standing.

You put your own life on the line, when you enter a gauntlet of destruction. As such, if you surrender during a gauntlet of destruction, you suffer the fate you wanted to inflict on your opponent and you perish.


## Gauntlet of Contention

This is the most common type of gauntlet used to settle most major disputes.

As the main goal during this type of gauntlet is not to destroy the other side but to achieve a specific goal, each side in a gauntlet of contention uses [Morale](#morale) to track their progress towards achieving their goal.

Gauntlets of contention come in two different varieties depending on the goal you want to achieve.

{: .important }
> Maro, after a long and arduous journey, finally confronts the man who murdered his father. Only one of them will make it out of here alive, so they enter a gauntlet of destruction.

### Mediate

You are trying to settle a difficult dispute. You do not want to hurt the other side, instead you want to demonstrate, make them understand.

During gauntlets of contention to mediate, when a character fails to defend, their opponent inflicts a [Misfortune](injury-&-misfortune#misfortune) with rating equal to their margin of success to the defender.

{: .important }
> Cyrene has been entangled in the mess of two warring families and has been swept up in a diplomatic confrontation as the two finally clash.
> 
> This calls for a gauntlet of contention to mediate and try to come to an agreement before it comes to bloodshed.

### Subjugate

You aim to impose your intentions, damn the opposition.

During gauntlets of contention to subjugate, when a character fails to defend, their opponent inflicts an [Injury](injury-&-misfortune#injury) with rating equal to their margin of success to the defender.

{: .important }
> Cyrene and Maro have discovered a group of cultist trying to conduct a vile ritual. This calls for a gauntlet of contention to subjugate and with the intent to inflict injury.
> 
> The cultist want to perform their ritual despite the disturbance, while cyrene and maro want to stop the ritual and capture one of the cultists for questioning. Goals have been established and the rival factions enter the gauntlet.


## Gauntlet of Enterprise

Though in most gauntlets there is an active opponent opposing you, sometimes the narrative calls for a gauntlet without such active opposition. For example, when you attempt to survive a long and arduous journey, create an unfathomable piece of art, or undertake a ludicrous economic endeavour.





# Acting during a Gauntlet

During a gauntlets, teams act in turns. Turn order is determined by whoever initiated the gauntlet.

During a team's turn each of its members may act in whatever order they choose until each member has acted once.  
Then the active team decides which team goes next. A team may not be chosen this way again until all teams have acted once.

To act, a character has three choices, either attack an opponent to inflict stress upon and damage their morale, try to gain an advantage just like you would during positioning, or surrender.


## Attacking

To attack, test the relevant skill with any attribute against an opponent of your choice. You may attack as a group.

If you achieved more effort than your opponent, depending on the type of conflict, you inflict your margin of effort as either an injury or misfortune to your opponent.

Anyone may help their teammates defend as a group when one of their allies is attacked, but they can only do so, if they are not themselves attacked.  
To keep an opponent from protecting one of their allies, have one of your teammates attack and occupy them.

Should you not have an empty injury box to absorb an injury you suffered during a gauntlet, and you spend Favor to gain a new trait (see [The Door of Death](injury-&-misfortune#the-door-of-death)), you must immediately choose one of the following two options:

- Immediately surrender from the gauntlet
- Enter your [Last Stand](#last-stand), if you have not yet entered it, to keep fighting


## Gaining an Advantage

Instead of testing the relevant skill to inflict injuries and misfortunes to an opponent, you may test a different skill to gain an advantage.  

You still choose an opponent who will try to stop or at least hinder your efforts.

Depending on your margin of effort, you gain an advantage. These advantages only last for the duration of the gauntlet.

There are four different types of advantages from which to choose. One general and three that are each available depending on with which attribute you tested.  

|   Attribute   |                                                Advantage                                                |
|:-------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|    **Any**    | [Create a Boon or Bane](boons-&-banes#creating-boons--banes) with rating equal to your margin of effort |
|   **Vigor**   |                                     Add **1** to your teamâ€™s morale                                     |
| **Intuition** |      Discard your opponent's lowest rated asset relevant to the gauntlet / Gain a discarded asset       |
|  **Reason**   |               Learn of your opponent's lowest rated secret trait, which is unknown to you               |

{: .important }
> The caravan Maro is escorting is being ambushed by bandits. One of the bandits is covered in mean battle scars, so Maro decides to leverage his superior mobility before engaging him directly. He tries to create a bane with Maneuver and Intuition on the bandit by running circles around him and throwing sand into his eyes. The bandit fails to defend against the attempt. Maro rolls **2** excess hits and creates a bane named `SAND IN MY EYES!` with rating **2** on the bandit.
>
> Anyone attacking the bandit or defending against one of his attacks may now add **2** to their roll once after which the bane vanishes.


## Surrendering

During their turn, a character may choose to surrender and remove themselves from the gauntlet. They can no longer influence the outcome, but they are out of harm's way.

If you surrender during a [Gauntlet of Destruction](#gauntlet-of-destruction), you perish.



# Preludes

In general, in {{ site.title }}, not ever does a gauntlet erupt spontaneously out of the blue. There is always at least a brief moment, a calm before the storm, in which sides anticipate imminent confrontation. If characters are surprised at the start of a gauntlet, then it should be only ever about _how_ their opponent engaged them, maybe even _who exactly_ engaged them but not ever that they were engaged at all.

Sometimes there is more than but a brief moment. For example, an army forming formation before a battle; hunters tracking a beast before the confrontation; a chase before interrogating a subject. For these occasions, introduce a prelude before the actual gauntlet.

During a prelude, all teams test to [Gain an Advantage](#gaining-an-advantage). If it would not make sense to gain that advantage through a contest, set the difficulty based on an environmental trait and resolve it as a challenge.



# Morale

During a gauntlet which uses morale, each team's capability to fight on is represented by their morale, or more specifically, the damage to their morale. A team captain's main responsibility is to ensure their team's morale does not break lest it threatens to lose the gauntlet.

## Building Morale

Whenever a character succeeds on a test, their captain adds **1** to their team's morale.

You may also [Gain and Advantage](#gaining-an-advantage) with Vigor to further increase your morale.

## Losing Morale

Whenever a character fails to succeed on a test, their captain subtracts **1** from their team's morale.

When a character surrenders or otherwise leaves a gauntlet, their captain subtracts **1** from their team's morale.

When a team's morale drops below **0,** the team gains a `BROKEN MORALE` trait with rating equal to the amount of morale they are below **0.**  
This trait counts as a character trait for each team member and may be used against them like any other character trait.

When a team's morale reaches **0** or more, they lose their `BROKEN MORALE` trait.

## Keeping Morale

When all members of a team have acted, its captain tests to keep morale if its morale has been broken.

At the end of each turn, if a team has a `BROKEN MORALE` trait, its captain must test a skill that is not the relevant skill to keep their team's morale from breaking. The test's base difficulty is equal to the `BROKEN MORALE` trait's rating.

If the captain does not succeed on the test, their team's morale breaks.  
Otherwise if the captain succeeds, or if the team does not have a `BROKEN MORALE` trait, the team keeps their morale.

A captain's teammates may help their captain keep morale by testing with them as a group (increase the test's difficulty by **1** for each teammate who tests beyond the captain).

When a team's captain surrenders or otherwise leaves a gauntlet, their team's morale immediately breaks.

When a team's morale breaks, it loses the gauntlet and does not achieve its goal, unless one of the team's members chooses to enter their [Last Stand](#last-stand), if they have not yet entered it, to take over the role of captain.



# Last Stand

Your last stand represents one last chance to still achieve your goal, to rage, potentially for the last time, even against the most desperate of odds.

During your last stand, resolve your actions as you normally would with the following two exceptions:

- Should all opposing teams have lost the gauntlet, you leave your last stand, and you live to see another day; you gain an [Epiphany](advancement#epiphany) for you have looked defeat in the eye and prevailed
- If, at any point during your last stand, you cannot fully absorb and injury, or your team loses the gauntlet (for example, by their morale breaking), you perish (depending on the type of gauntlet, you either die in battle, are exiled forever, completely lose you mind, etc.)
