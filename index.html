To play, you need pen, paper, a handful six-sided dice (<strong>d6</strong>), one player to assume the role of Game Master (<strong>GM</strong>) and 1-5 additional players who are each responsible for one Player Character (<strong>PC</strong>).</p><figure> <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b9/9f/7f/b99f7f7dd09e7d34ff50f38dbd5c8501.jpg" alt="Wizard" /><figcaption>Pictured: me writing rules about imagining fighting monsters in a fictional world.</figcaption></figure><p>PCs exist in a fictional world in which they act, struggle, and succeed. The players’ role is to bring their PC to life and the GM’s responsibility is to breath life into the rest of this fictional world with descriptions, challenges, and Non-Player Characters (<strong>NPCs</strong>).</p><p>The PCs interact with the situation and the world presented by the GM by asking questions and narrating what they would like their characters to accomplish and how they would like to do so until the outcome of an action is no longer certain and the group consults the dice (see <a href="#consulting-the-dice">Consulting the Dice</a>).</p><h1 id="characters-in-rpg-thingy"> <a href="#characters-in-rpg-thingy" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="characters-in-rpg-thingy"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Characters in rpg-thingy</h1><p>To play a Player Character (<strong>PC</strong>) in rpg-thingy means to toke on the mantle of fictional character. You make choices on behalf of that fictional character. Choices that will put your character in danger, choices that will protect them from harm but never choices that take them out of trouble.</p><figure> <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7d/49/12/7d49128d3c55ef6d822bd949be425c2f.jpg" alt="Dark Forest" /><figcaption>"You enter the forest at the darkest point, where there is no path." — Joseph Campbell</figcaption></figure><p>Characters in rpg-thingy heroes and heroes come in many forms. They can be valiant adventurers, daring scoundrels, wise sages, knights in shining armor, thrifty merchants, cunning diplomats, stoic smiths, disciplined spies, or even kindly bakers.<br /> They are people with goals who are competent in their area of expertise, but they cannot be competent at everything. It is inevitable that they will fail but characters in rpg-thingy shy away from such challenges.<br /> Failure is the best teacher, so they say.</p><p>Part of the fun of playing a character in rpg-thingy is watching them succeed at what they excel and even more when they do so on nothing but naked luck. But most of the fun is watching them grow with their challenges, to be in their head as they surmount difficult challenges and face their demons. Be that literal demons, a missing leg, a domineering ego, or a fear of public speaking. This is what makes them heroes in the end. Not the number of monsters they slay, not the hoards of treasure they find, or the songs that are sung about them, but that they face the challenges that scare them the most.</p><p>At their core, characters in rpg-thingy believe a truth that propels them forwards and a lie about the world or themselves that keeps them from achieving their full potential. They are emotional beings on an emotional journey to face that lie and this game is about that journey. And when it ends, they must find another dragon to slay, so to say, or they no longer qualify to be PCs, as they settle down, travel to distant lands, or perish. Either as better people because they faced their lie or worse for they fled when the abyss looked back into them.</p><p>More about characters and how to create on in the chapter about <a href="character">Characters</a>.</p><h1 id="consulting-the-dice"> <a href="#consulting-the-dice" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="consulting-the-dice"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Consulting the Dice</h1><p>If you want to hit a baddie with your sword, bribe a guard, or try to walk across a tightrope, we might have a rough idea what is more likely to happen, but we cannot know for certain. It’s the moment we roll the dice to open a fleeting portal to the fictional world, so it may answer our questions.</p><figure> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/8jYjsCF.jpg" alt="Male-swordsman-fighting3orcs-scene" /><figcaption>A fight is the classic situation where its outcome is anything but certain.</figcaption></figure><p>When you consult the dice, the game calls it a <strong>Skill Test.</strong> rpg-thingy uses a <strong>d6</strong> dice pool system. So whenever the game calls for dice to be rolled, roll a handful of six-sided dice. Each die can either be a hit or a miss, depending on if its face shows at least a certain number. All hits counted together are called <strong>Effort.</strong> Achieving more Effort is always better.</p><p>A test has a difficulty, a number that defines how much Effort it takes to succeed on the test, otherwise the test is a failure. There are no tests without consequences. No matter if you succeed on a test or fail it, you will either get what you want or suffer a setback. Either way, after a test both the narrative and your character make progress, either by achieving your goal or by growing with your failures.</p><p>As mentioned above, the dice are consulted when the outcome of an action is uncertain. <a href="skill-tests">Skill Tests</a> and the <a href="skill-tests#certainty-of-actions">Certainty of Actions</a> are discussed in more detail in their respective chapter.</p><h1 id="the-5-pillars"> <a href="#the-5-pillars" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="the-5-pillars"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> The 5 Pillars</h1><p>The following pages will provide more detailed rules on how rpg-thingy works, though, in short, it tries to achieve a certain vision of how a game of rpg-thingy looks like. All rules decisions aim to contribute to achieve that vision, and they all rest on the following 5 pillars representing ideals to which rpg-thingy strives to adhere.</p><blockquote class="note-title"><p>Agency</p><ul><li>There are no actions without consequences<li>Choose your own path and leave your mark on the world<li>Be creative with the tools you have</ul></blockquote><blockquote class="note-title"><p>Exploration</p><ul><li>There are secrets hidden everywhere<li>Venturing into dangerous parts of the world yields the biggest rewards<li>There is nothing more powerful than paying attention and asking questions</ul></blockquote><blockquote class="note-title"><p>Strategy</p><ul><li>Always consider what you want to accomplish next and how to tackle it<li>There is always a goal to achieve or a wound to mend<li>Face challenges and enemies as attentive and well-prepared as you can</ul></blockquote><blockquote class="note-title"><p>Heroism</p><ul><li>There is no greater act of heroism than facing what you are most afraid of<li>Find what your character treasures and protect it<li>Shine a bright beacon into the vast unknown</ul></blockquote><blockquote class="note-title"><p>Growth</p><ul><li>The world will fade to darkness without your light, so kindle it<li>Do no shy away from challenges and grow with them instead<li>Live not to destroy but to build and improve</ul></blockquote><hr /><hr><footer><p><a href="#top" id="back-to-top">Back to top</a></p><div class="d-flex mt-2"></div></footer></div></div><a href="#" id="search-button" class="search-button"> <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="icon"><use xlink:href="#svg-search"></use></svg> </a><div class="search-overlay"></div></div><script> var config = {} ; mermaid.initialize(config); window.mermaid.init(undefined, document.querySelectorAll('.language-mermaid')); </script>
