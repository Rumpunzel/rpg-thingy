# Character Creation

Start with:
- Crucible & Pyre (both rating **2**)
- **3** traits with rating **1**
- **1** in each attribute

**11** points

**1** point:
- [4x] **+1** in an attribute
- [7x] **+1** level in a skill
- May gain **+1** rating of a trait instead of an increase to and attribute and a skill

When creating your character, you may not take more talents and feats belonging to an attribute than your rating in that attribute.
