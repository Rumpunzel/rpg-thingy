# Characters in Forge Gauntlet

To play a Player Character (**PC**) in Forge Gauntlet means to toke on the mantle of fictional character. You make choices on behalf of that fictional character. Choices that will put your character in danger, choices that will protect them from harm but never choices that take them out of trouble.

Characters in Forge Gauntlet heroes and heroes come in many forms. They can be valiant adventurers, daring scoundrels, wise sages, knights in shining armor, thrifty merchants, cunning diplomats, stoic smiths, disciplined spies, kindly bakers, or even devious blackguards.  
They are people with goals who are competent in their area of expertise, but they cannot be competent at everything. It is inevitable that they will fail but characters in Forge Gauntlet shy away from such challenges.  
Failure is the best teacher, so they say.

Part of the fun of playing a character in Forge Gauntlet is watching them succeed at what they excel and even more when they do so on nothing but naked luck. But most of the fun is watching them grow with their challenges, to be in their head as they surmount difficult challenges and face their demons. Be that literal demons, a missing leg, a domineering ego, or a fear of public speaking. This is what makes them heroes in the end. Not the number of monsters they slay, not the hoards of treasure they find, or the songs that are sung about them, but that they face the challenges that scare them the most.

At their core, characters in Forge Gauntlet believe a truth that propels them forwards and a lie about the world or themselves that keeps them from achieving their full potential. They are emotional beings on an emotional journey to face that lie and this game is about that journey. And when it ends, they must find another dragon to slay, so to say, or they no longer qualify to be PCs, as they settle down, travel to distant lands, or perish. Either as better people because they faced their lie or worse for they fled when the abyss looked back into them.
