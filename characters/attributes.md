# Attributes

Each character has three attributes: **Vigor,** **Intuition,** and **Reason.**

Each attribute also has a numerical rating, which determines how many dice you roll when you test with that attribute. The rating is an objective measure of your character's potential effort they can muster when doing tasks. For example, a bear has more Vigor than a mouse and a dragon even more than almost anything.

Each attribute represents a different way for your characters approaches problems. How well do they coerce other people into giving them what they want or are they better at relating to others to form connections, or do they build up their case and negotiate? Do they rush in to face their enemies without fear, do they fade into the shadows when they skulk around instead, or how deftly outmaneuver them from a distance? How strong are they, how nimble, how clever?  
That is represented by your character's attributes. Your character may approach any problem however they like but their attributes determine what they feel most comfortably doing, or perhaps even how flexible they are.

Your character's attribute ratings are fundamental to they are and how they interact with the world and will change only marginally over the course of their story.


## Vigor

Vigor embodies immediacy, grit, and overwhelming force.

It's a matter of facing problems directly, head-on, courageous, and with conviction always at your side. A matter of going all out to win it and to win big. As such, it is the attribute most closely linked to the harnessing of fiery emotions.

Strength, endurance, tenacity, panache, ferocity, wealth, fame, and power of will are all different aspects of Vigor.

If your character has a high Vigor rating, they excel whenever they swing their mighty axe in a blinded rage, whenever they embolden their compatriots with a fiery speech, whenever they perform an impressive feat of strength, whenever they labor for hours on end at their forge, whenever they weave a heart-breaking tune on their lyre, whenever they shrug off a hit, or whenever they leverage their fame and wealth.


## Intuition

Intuition embodies reactivity, improvisation, and fluid adaptability.

It's a matter of utilizing opportunities in the heat of the moment and with the element of surprise always on your side. A matter of tipping the scales in your favour by paying close attention and going with the flow.

Flexibility, nimbleness, guile, reflexes, perceptiveness, wit, connections, and empathy are all different aspects of Intuition.

If your character has a high Intuition rating, they excel whenever they swirl their blade like a dervish, whenever they outfox their enemies with their silver tongue, whenever they dodge to safety at the lase possible moment, whenever they know exactly the right thing to say to empathize with people, whenever they craft an astounding piece of art, whenever they balance across a steep ravine without breaking a sweat, or whenever they know just the right person.


## Reason

Reason embodies prevention, foresight, and rigorous determination.

It's a matter of meeting problems on your own terms and with a contingency plan always by your side. A matter of knowing your enemies, their blind spots, and taking the time to masterfully exploit them.

Precision, deftness, intellect, foresight, research, industriousness, and rigor are all different aspects of Reason.

If your character has a high Reason rating, they excel whenever you fell the rider approaching from the horizon with a single arrow, whenever you facilitate genuine understanding between warring parties, whenever you engineer a baffling mechanism, whenever doom misses you by a mile as you were expecting it, whenever you mend a grievous wound, whenever you find yourself in a race with fate one step ahead.


## Dice Modifiers

When you test with an attribute, and you have a [Trait](traits) representing either your expertise or adeptness in the task you are tackling, depending on the attribute you test with, you may change how the dice are rolled.

|   Attribute   | Modifier Name |                      Effect                      |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:------------------------------------------------:|
|   **Vigor**   |    Fervor     | For each **6** you roll, roll an additional die. |
| **Intuition** |    Fortune    |      Re-roll each die that comes up **1**.       |
|  **Reason**   |     Focus     |          You may re-roll all dice once.          |

# Disposition

The three attributes do not only form the foundation of your character but of all other characters and creatures you will encounter on your adventures, sometimes even the environment itself.

The scoundrel, who ambushes you in the gloomy ally; the moonlit lord, who anticipates your every move; even passive obstacles such as a river's roaring current, they all have attributes just like you.  
When you create your character, you choose one of two possible dispositions you have against these foes, and edge you have during conflicts. Your disposition represents a certain knack you have against the other approaches, a weakness you might exploit. But beware, for your enemies also have dispositions.

Your disposition may impose a penalty on your target when they defend against you with a certain attribute. Each of your attributes is disposed against one of the other two attributes. During conflicts, when an opponent defend against you with an attribute you are disposed against, they can only prevent stress you deal them _or_ damage you deal to their team's morale, not both.


## Disposition I

**Your Vigor overwhelms Reason:** You are a force too overwhelming, your attacks are too mighty, your speeches are too gripping, they cannot be faced with a cool demeanour for you leave no demeanour cool.

**Your Intuition outpaces Vigor:** You change course too deftly, your attacks are a stunning barrage, your lies are too tricky a web to navigate, they cannot be faced head-on with brute force for you bend like grass in the wind.

**Your Reason outsmarts Intuition:** Your plans are too well-thought-out, your attacks are too precise, your rhetorical traps are too sophisticated, they cannot be weaseled out of for you have thought of everything.

## Disposition II

**Your Vigor overwhelms Intuition:** You are a force too overwhelming, your attacks are too mighty, your speeches are too gripping, they cannot be faced with the cowardice of a weasel for you leave no place left to hide.

**Your Intuition outpaces Reason:** You change course too deftly, your attacks are a stunning barrage, your lies are too tricky a web to navigate, they cannot be faced with a cool demeanour for they still think about your last move while you are crossing the finish line.

**Your Reason outsmarts Vigor:** Your plans are too well-thought-out, your attacks are too precise, your rhetorical traps are too sophisticated, they cannot be faced head-on with brute force for every careless step spells disaster.
