# The Gauntlet Forge

People are the very heart of this roleplaying game. Their struggles, their virtues, their faults, and their relationships; in short: their stories.  
There are also battles, monsters, intrigue, and treasure, but they only matter in their relation to people. Who would care about a monster that scares no one, who about a treasure that no one wants, who about a throne in a kingdom without people? 

Your character is one of these people, but they matter more than any of the others because through them, you influence the world. They are your metaphorical hand in the fictional world. But in a way, they are also how you experience this fictional world. A world that is dangerous, awe-inspiring, and full of people who are convinced just as you are that they are the hero of this (or at least their) story.

Though you actually are the hero of this story. And that is no light responsibility to bear. They — and, by proxy, you — are the heart of all the drama. To you, there is no monsters more important than the one that most scares your character and no treasure more precious than the one they covet most. So your characters needs something to care about, something that motivates them to put themselves in harm's way. And they need something to terrify them, something they dare not even look at for there seems no way to overcome it.

The Gauntlet Forge calls these Crucible and Fire. A crucible to contain your story and the fire to smelt the prizes of the gauntlet, and the tribulations your character endures to forge a gauntlet for that metaphorical hand of yours. To forge a story wroth remembering. And who knows, perhaps we might even grow a little with them.


## The Crucible

Your Crucible is a special [Trait](traits) at the center of your character's identity. It is something about your character or something they believe about themself or the world, which is objectively true.

You can either phrase it like a normal trait...

{: .important-title }
Legendary blademaster from the far east

{: .important-title }
Brave protector with a bleeding heart

...or as phrase or quote it as a statement your character might regularly think, say, or embody.

{: .important-title }
"The traitor who killed my father must die."

{: .important-title }
"BY THE POWER OF GRAYSKULL, I HAVE THE POWER!"

The Crucible you formulate for your character is incredibly useful for your fellow players. It tells everyone at the table what you want to do with your character. If your Crucible is `Patriarch of the Goldwyn family`, then that is not up to question; you are the patriarch of the Goldwyn family, and it's what you were born to be.

It describes what is most central to your character and as such, it is a container for their story.
If your Crucible is `Legendary blademaster from the far east`, then both the fact that your character is a legendary blademaster and that they are from a distant land frame their entire story. Even if the heart of their story is about something else entirely, such as negotiating peace or becoming a world-renown chef.

The sign of a good Crucible is that whenever you find yourself in a dire situation or unsure what to do next, you can look at your character sheet, and it nudges you into the right direction, even against your better judgement.

## The Fire

Just like your Anchor, your character believes in, you can phrase the Lie your they believe either as a statement about them or as something they regularly think or say, though the Lie is not objectively true. To be more precise, it comes in two different flavors:

A conviction your character believes to be true, wittingly or unwittingly, though it is a delusion, a self-deception or misjudgement about their surroundings that you, as a player, know to be incorrect. The central questions such a Lie poses are: How will the character learn? What will it take? Where will it take? Will they find the courage to face the truth when push comes to shove?

{: .important-title }
I owe the Order of the Silver Falcon my life. There is no nobler goal than to give my life to repay my debt. 

{: .important-title }
I have left my life as a mercenary behind me. Is now a well-adjusted, productive member of society.

A conjecture about your character that might or might not be true. Neither your character nor you know if it true or not. A Lie that is a conjecture is often _possibly_ true and the character's journey will consist of them proving that they were right to believe so from the start or learn the hard way that they were mistaken. The central question such a Lie poses is: Is this true?

{: .important-title }
"I am not worthy to inherit my master's workshop."

{: .important-title }
"The traitor who killed my father must die."

As you can see, the same phrase can be used either as a Truth or a Lie, though its meaning drastically shifts. As a Truth, `"The traitor who killed my father must die."` is a goal your character has that they will either fulfill or die trying. As a Lie, it is meant to be challenged as the story progresses. Does he indeed deserve to die? What did my father do that he was betrayed and murdered? Am I at fault for my father's death? These are all questions that only result from Lies, for they are meant to be challenged, not from Truths.


## Forging the Gauntlet

In a way, the Lie is a lot more central to your character's story but the Truth is just as important, for it is what will drive them to press on when everything else tells them to give in.

Though it is implied that a Lie is always successfully challenged in the course of your character's story, so they may change for the better, it is totally legitimate to go on a lengthy journey only for your character to double down on his delusions, to refuse to face the Lie. Naturally, there will be no true happy end for such a character but that does not mean that the end to their story can not be fascinating and satisfying in its own way.



# Goals

At the start of each session, choose a goal for your character to achieve during that session. Try to include _what_ you want to achieve as well as a rough idea of _how_ and _why_ your character is eager to complete that goal.

At the end of each session, if you have achieved your goal, mark **1** **XP** for any of your skills.



# Favor

**Favor** is a meta-currency you can spend to influence your dice rolls, tilt luck in your favor, bite through the pain, or sometimes even fuel powerful magic.  
Depending on your character, it might represent how much lady luck smiles upon you, the good graces of the higher forces you hold sacred, or your iron will and determination.

Whenever the Truth or Lie really come out through how you roleplay your character or through the drama that results from your choices, you earn **1** Favor for your character.

### Empowering Traits

If the trait you use has a rating of **2,** you may use an additional dice modifier of different attribute on that roll as well. You choose which of the two other dice modifiers you want to use.

If the trait you use has a rating of **3,** you may use all dice modifiers of all attributes on that roll. This is incredibly powerful.

If the action you are trying to undertake aligns with the Truth you have chosen for your character, you may spend **1** Favor to temporarily increase the rating of a trait by **1** for the duration of a test.  
If you do not having a fitting trait when undertaking such an action, you may also spend **1** Favor to temporarily gain the benefits as if you had a fitting trait with rating **1.**
