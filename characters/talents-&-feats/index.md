# Talents & Feats

Talents & Feats are special abilities you can unlock for your character's skills. There are two categories of talents & feats: Feats and Specializations. Feats grant you new abilities or completely modify the rules for your character. Specializations enhance your character's ability for the skill they belong to and have more specific use cases compared to Feats.

Whenever you leve up a skill, you gain a talent or feat. In most cases you gain a talent, but if your skill training improves with that level up, you gain a feat instead.

Each talent and feat is associated with one of the three attributes, **Vigor,** **Intuition,** or **Reason.** For each skill, you may at most have **1** feat for each attribute, and you may only have **2** talents for each attribute.
