# Influence Feats

### Fiery Orator

Boons you create with Vigor become enduring if you rolled at least one **6** and no **1s.**

---

### Dreamer

Once during a rest, you may test Influence with Intuition to divine the future. Choose the difficulty for this test.

If you succeed, you gain an enduring boon with rating equal to the test's difficulty spent representing a prophetic vision you had while resting. Consult with the GM concerning the nature of the vision.

If you fail, you gain an enduring bane with rating equal to your margin of failure representing a prophetic omen you had while resting. The GM determines the nature of the omen.

The boon and bane may be used by anyone, with any skill, and with any attribute but only in the context or with the subject of your dream.

---

### Iron Will

Reduce the rating of all misfortunes you suffer by **1.**



# Influence Talents

### Relentless

When defending with Vigor, each **6** counts as two hits.

### Stubborn

Ignore your opponent's disposition as long as you have rolled at least one **6.**

### Valiant Leader

When you succeed on a test during gauntlets, increase your team's morale by an additional **1** if you rolled at least one **6** on a test.

---

### Caregiver

While resting, you and everyone resting with you add **1** die when testing to mend injury. Additionally, the number of paraphernalia required to gain a `WELL RESTED` boon is reduced by **1** for everyone resting with you.

### Haggler

Decrease the difficulty of buying assets by **1** to a minimum of **1.**

### Web of Lies

When creating a boon with Influence and Intuition, you may gain an asset with rating equal to your margin of effort instead of a boon.

---

### Where there's a Will

During gauntlets, you may choose to suffer an injury with the rating of your choice. When you do, create an enduring boon on yourself with rating equal to the rating of the injury you suffered.

### Schemer

If your morale during gauntlets is above **0,** your team gains a `PROGRESSING SCHEME` trait with rating equal to your team's morale, which counts as a character trait for your team.
