# Influence Feats

###



---

### Dreamer

Once during a rest, you may test Influence with Intuition to divine the future. Choose the difficulty for this test.

If you succeed, you gain a boon with rating equal to the test's difficulty spent representing a prophetic vision you had while resting. Consult with the GM concerning the nature of the vision.

If you fail, you gain a bane with rating equal to your margin of failure representing a prophetic omen you had while resting. The GM determines the nature of the omen.

The boon and bane may be used by anyone, with any skill, and with any attribute but only in the context or with the subject of your dream.
