# Skills

There are **6** skills in total: **Influence,** **Fight,** **Maneuver,** **Wilderness,** **Craft,** and **Resources**.  
Skills represent both an area of expertise, something a character may or may not be trained or even an expert in and a section of the challenges they will face. Each adventure will be different but each adventure will consist of these **6** different types of challenges to varying degrees.

|           Skill           |                           Uses                            |
|:-------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------:|
|  [Influence](#influence)  |                  Interacting with people                  |
|      [Fight](#fight)      |          Hurting others and defending from harm           |
|   [Maneuver](#maneuver)   |          Overcoming immediate physical obstacles          |
| [Wilderness](#wilderness) |             Navigating and surviving the wild             |
|      [Craft](#craft)      |       Creating tools and structures; manual labour        |
|  [Resources](#resources)  | Leveraging wealth, connections, and sources of knowledge  |

A skill has a corresponding number denoting the character's training. The default is **6+.** This number denotes what is the lowest number on a die that counts as a success when that character rolls that Skill.

- **Untrained** -- a character has **6+** in the corresponding skill
- **Trained** -- a character has **5+** in the skill
- **Expert** -- a character has **4+**
- **Master** -- a character has **3+** (this is quite uncommon)

Whenever the game calls for a test, it will always call for an attribute and a skill. The attribute determines how many dice you roll and the skill determines what faces of the dice result in a hit or a miss.


## Experience Points

Whenever you do not succeed on a skill test, you learn something new and mark **1** experience (**XP**) for that skill. Each Skill has a separate track to mark **XP** and whenever you reach **10** **XP** marked for a skill, remove all **XP** marked for it and you gain a new level in that skill (each skill starts at level **0**), which will grant you access to a new [Talents](talents) and/or improve your training in that Skill (see [Advancement](../playing-the-game/advancement)).

If your skill is reaches level **7** and for every level thereafter, instead of improving the skill, you gain an [Epiphany](../playing-the-game/advancement#epiphanies) (meaning you may increase **1** of your attributes by **1** or increase the rating of **1** of your traits by **1**).

| Level  | XP  | Training |     Reward     |
|:------:|:---:|:--------:|:--------------:|
| **0**  |  0  |    6+    |       -        |
| **1**  | 10  |    5+    |      Feat      |
| **2**  | 20  |    -     | Specialization |
| **3**  | 30  |    4+    |      Feat      |
| **4**  | 40  |    -     | Specialization |
| **5**  | 50  |    -     | Specialization |
| **6**  | 60  |    3+    |      Feat      |
