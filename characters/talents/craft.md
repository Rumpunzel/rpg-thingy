# Vigor Feats

### War Smith

You may ignore the **Refined with RESOURCE** property of weapon and armor assets.

### Renown

Double your successes when working in a settlement while resting.



# Intuition Feats

### Trickster

Boons you create with Craft and Intuition only vanish (or degrade) if you do not succeed on the test.



# Reason Feats

### Engineer

When creating or improving an asset with a property, you may double the property's effort when determining difficulty.

### Surgeon

When mending a condition with Craft while resting, instead of mending it by **1,** you may mend it by the number of your margin of effort.

# Vigor Specializations

### Farmhand

You may forage when resting even in settlements. When you do, you may use Craft instead of Wilderness or Means to forage. Instead of boons, you create assets while foraging and the assets have the **Fortified** property (do not degrade if their rating is greater than the difficulty of tests they are used on).



# Intuition Specializations

### Always Prepared

Boons and banes you create with Craft during positioning for a conflict are enduring.

### Ingenuity

Get **1** additional die when crafting assets.



# Reason Specializations

### Master Artisan

When you invoke a trait representing your mastery over the relevant skill, instead of re-rolling or adding any dice, you may increase your training for the relevant skill by one tier (from **6** to **5+**, from **5+** to **4+** etc.). You cannot have used any dice modifiers for that roll to use this benefit, and you may not use any dice modifiers afterward either.

### Traps Everywhere

You may create a special `Traps` assets which may be used by your entire team and for any skill with any attribute.
