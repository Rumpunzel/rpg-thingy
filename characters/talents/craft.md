# Craft Feats

---

### Master Artisan

When you use a trait representing your mastery over the relevant skill to gain the Intuition dice modifier, instead of re-rolling all **1s,** you may increase your training for the relevant skill by one tier (from **6** to **5+,** from **5+** to **4+,** from **4+** to **3+,** and from **3+** to **2+**).

### Trickster

Boons you create with Intuition only vanish (or degrade) if you do not succeed on the test.

---

### Ingenuity

Get **1** additional die when crafting assets.

### Excellent Craftsmanship

Choose a skill when you gain this talent. Your assets for the chosen skill only degrade when you do not succeed on the test.



# Craft Specializations

### Farmhand

You may forage when resting even in settlements. When you do, you may use Craft instead of Wilderness or Means to forage. Instead of boons, you create assets while foraging and the assets have the **Fortified** property (do not degrade if their rating is greater than the difficulty of tests they are used on).

### Renown

Double your successes when working in a settlement while resting.

### War Smith

You may ignore **1** **Refined with RESOURCE** property of weapon and armor assets.

---

### Always Prepared

Boons and banes you create with Craft are enduring.

---

### Surgeon

When mending a condition with Craft while resting, instead of mending it by **1,** you may mend it by the number of your margin of effort.

### Traps Everywhere

You may create a special `Traps` assets with Craft and Reason which may be used by your entire team and for any skill with any attribute.
