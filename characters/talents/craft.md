# Craft Feats

### Problem Solver

When using a trait for a dice modifier, you may choose which dice modifier to use for the roll, regardless of the attribute you chose.

### Resourceful

If you roll at least one **6** on a test, one asset of your choice you used on that test does not degrade.

---

### Opportunist

When using an opponent's trait or wound, increase its rating by **1** for the test.

### Trickster

Boons you create with Intuition only vanish (or degrade) if you do not succeed on the test.

---

### Ingenuity

Whenever you create or improve an asset, if you rolled at least one **6** and no **1s,** increase its quality rating **1** additional time.

### Master Artisan

When you use a trait representing your mastery over the relevant skill to gain the Intuition dice modifier, instead of re-rolling all **1s,** you may increase your training for the relevant skill by one tier (from **6** to **5+,** from **5+** to **4+,** from **4+** to **3+,** and from **3+** to **2+**).



# Craft Specializations

### Farmhand

You may forage when resting even in settlements. When you do, you may use Craft instead of Wilderness or Resources to forage. Instead of boons, you create assets while foraging and the assets have the **Fortified** property (do not degrade if their rating is greater than the difficulty of tests they are used on).

### War Smith

You may ignore **1** **Refined with PARAPHERNALIA** property of weapon and armor assets.

---

### Trinkets & Baubles

Get **1** additional die when crafting assets.

### Learning on the Job

While resting, if someone gains **XP** through practice, they gain **1** additional **XP.** If that someone is not you, you also get **1** **XP** in the practiced skill.

---

### Surgeon

When mending a wound with Craft while resting, instead of mending it by **1,** you may mend it by the number of your margin of effort.

### Traps Everywhere

You may create a special `Traps` assets with Craft and Reason which may be used by your entire team and for any skill with any attribute.
