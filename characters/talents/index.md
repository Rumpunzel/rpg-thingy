# Talents

Talents are special abilities you can unlock for your character's skills. There are two categories of talents: Feats and Specializations. Feats enhance your character's ability or slightly bend the rules. Specializations grant you new abilities or completely change the rules for your character.

Whenever you leve up a skill, you gain a talent. In most cases you gain a Feat, but if your skill training improves with that level up, you gain a Specialization instead.

Each talent is associated with one of the three attributes, **Vigor,** **Intuition,** or **Reason.** For each skill, you may at most have **2** Feats which belong to same attribute, and you may only have **1** Specialization which belongs to each attribute.
