# Vigor Feats

### Bolster

When defending with Fight, each **6** counts as two hits.

### Reckless

When creating a boon with Vigor during a Fight conflict, you may make it enduring by gaining a `Reckless` bane with rating equal to the created boon's rating. The `Reckless` bane only hinders you when defending.

### Steadfast

When defending with Vigor against multiple opponents, roll an additional die for each opponent attacking you.



# Intuition Feats

### Parry

May defend with weapons without penalty.

### Riposte

When successfully defending with Fight and Intuition, in addition to inflicting morale damaging, you may also inflict stress equal the morale damage dealt.

### Uncanny Dodge

During Fight conflicts, you may spend **1** Favor to suffer a **1** physical or mental stress (your choice) instead of resolving a defense test.



# Reason Feats

### Battle Tactician

When positioning for a Fight conflict, you may test for positioning twice and gain two different benefits.

### Shield Training

When adding dice from a shield asset to a defense roll, add **1** additional die.

### Armor Training

Armor assets you use, gain the **Versatile** property (they do not automatically degrade when used with a different attribute than intended).

# Vigor Specializations

### Juggernaut

When attacking, roll an additional die for each opponent defending against you.

### Slayer

When attacking with Vigor in a Fight conflict, you always inflict at least **1** stress for each **6** you rolled, even if your opponent defended successfully (this does not increase the damage to the opponent's morale).

### Martial Artist (Defend)

Choose one of your traits representing your martial training; when defending with Fight, your minimum effort is equal to the chosen trait's rating.



# Intuition Specializations

### Battle Master

You may act twice during your turn in Fight conflicts.

### Pack Tactics

When attacking as a group with Intuition, your allies do not increase the difficulty and not add extra dice for your opponent(s).



# Reason Specializations

### Peace of Mind

Mental conditions no longer hinder your attacks. At the beginning of a Fight conflict, if you suffer from a mental condition, you may gain an enduring `Battle Trance` boon with rating equal to the condition's rating.

### Marksman

When attacking with Fight and using the Reason dice modifier, you may choose which dice to re-roll instead of re-rolling all at once.

### Martial Artist (Attack)

Choose one of your traits representing your martial training; when attacking with Fight, your minimum effort is equal to the chosen trait's rating.
