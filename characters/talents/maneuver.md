# Maneuver Feats

### Bull Charge

Vigor also struggles to defend against your Vigor.

### Steadfast

When defending with Vigor, roll an additional die for each opponent attacking you.

---

### Pack Tactics

When attacking as a group with Intuition, your allies do not increase the difficulty and not add extra dice for your opponents.

### Slippery

Opponents can only create boons or banes against you if you struggle to defend because of their disposition.

---

### Superior Strategist

When positioning for a conflict, you may test for positioning twice and gain two different benefits.

### One Step Ahead

During contests, ties count as successes for you, even if you're the attacker. During conflicts, you inflict **1** damage to your opponent's morale on ties. These benefits do not work should your opponent also have this talent.



# Maneuver Specializations

### ONE FOR ALL AND ALL FOR ONE!

When defending as a group with Vigor, your allies do not increase the difficulty and do not add extra dice for your opponents.

### Shrug it Off

When recovering from your own conditions decrease the test's difficulty by **1** (this means you can potentially recover from minor conditions without needing paraphernalia or needing to roll).

---

### Uncanny Dodge

During Fight, Maneuver, and Wilderness conflicts, you may spend **1** Favor to suffer a **1** physical or mental stress (your choice) instead of resolving a defense test.

### Dazzling Elegance

As long as you do not have any conditions, you get **1** additional die on all your rolls.

---

### Peace of Body and Mind

Conditions cannot hinder your attacks.  
At the beginning of a conflict, if you suffer from a condition, you may gain an enduring `Battle Trance` boon with rating equal to your highest rated condition's rating.

### Untouchable Grace

When you would gain physical stress while defending with Intuition, you may gain it as a mental stress instead.
