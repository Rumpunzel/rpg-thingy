# Influence Feats

### Relentless

When defending with Vigor, each **6** counts as two hits.

### Stubborn

Ignore your opponent's disposition as long as you have rolled at least one **6.**

---

### Dreamer

During a rest, you may spend paraphernalia to gain an enduring boon with rating equal to the paraphernalia spent representing a prophetic dream you had while resting. Consult with the GM concerning the nature of the dream. The boon may be used by anyone, with any skill, and with any attribute but only in the context or with the subject of your dream.

### Takes One to Know One

Your Intuition outpaces Intuition as well.

---

### Haggler

Decrease the difficulty of buying assets by **1** to a minimum of **1.**

### Iron Will

Reduce all mental stress you take by **1.**



# Influence Specializations

### Fiery Orator

Boons you create become enduring if you rolled at least one **6** and no **1s.**

### Valiant Leader

During gauntlets, increase your team's morale by an additional **1** if you rolled at least one **6** on a test.

---

### Empath

While resting, you and everyone resting with you may add **1** die when testing to mend wounds. Additionally, the number of paraphernalia required to gain a `WELL RESTED` boon is reduced by **1** for everyone resting with you.

### Web of Lies

When creating a boon with Influence and Intuition, you may gain an asset with rating equal to your margin of effort instead of a boon.

---

### Where there's a Will

During gauntlets, you may choose a number and suffer that much stress. When you do, create a boon on yourself with rating equal to the amount of stress you suffered.

### Schemer

During gauntlets, instead of gaining morale, you may create a special, secret `SCHEME` trait or improve the rating of an existing `SCHEME` trait by **1.**
