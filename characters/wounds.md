# Wounds

Wounds are temporary but unavoidable negative consequences of when you suffer [Stress](#stress) your daring adventures. They will get in your way and, with time, fester if not looked after. And worst of all, they will help the blackguards who cross your way until you get rid of them.

Wounds have a number associated with them called their [Severity](#wound-severities). A wounds severity increases as you gain stress during your adventures.

Simple tests always have a minimum difficulty equal to the highest severity of your appropriate wounds. If an uncontested test already has a higher difficulty, your wounds do not increase it.

During contests, your opponents may use your wounds to their advantage. Your opponent's minimum effort when testing against you is equal to the highest severity of your appropriate wounds.  
You may use your opponents' wounds against them for minimum effort in the same way as your opponent's can use yours against you.

The rules on when a wound hinders you on which kind of test are supposed to be a solid foundation to operate on but by no means law set in stone. As wounds are named after the circumstance they were inflicted, a wound's name might suggest that it should be applicable in even broader circumstances.  
Mental wounds are a prime example that might hinder you in almost any circumstance, even if the wound is not major.
Or, for example, a social wound marking you as a wanted for a gruesome murder might even hinder you on Wilderness tests as the tales of your misdeeds travelled across the land and no one you meet on the road is willing to help you, even getting in your way, and you must keep from the travelled road.


## Wound Types

You have **1** slot for each a physical, mental, and social wound. When the rules call for an _appropriate_ wound, they reference the different types of wounds as not all wounds will hinder you on every test.

Your wound slots start of empty. Whenever you suffer stress of a certain type, mark the lowest available stress box in the slot of that type. If that slot had no stress boxes marked previously, name and add a wound into the slot (see [Stress](#stress)).


### Physical Wounds

These wounds encompass all types of physical trauma, bodily injury and weariness. A cut from a blade is a physical wound, so is exhaustion from excessive travelling, and so are sickness and poisoning.

Physical wounds hinder you on Fight, Maneuver, Wilderness, and Craft tests. Wounds nor exhaustion get in the way of your concentration and coordination.

While resting, you can mend physical wounds by testing Craft, though not all severities can be mended with all [Attributes](attributes).

- **Minor physical wounds can be mended with any attribute.**
- **Moderate physical wounds can be mended with Intuition and Reason.** Some sense for field dressing or at least attentive care are required for these kinds of wounds.
- **Major physical wounds can only be mended with Reason.** Practiced surgery is required to close these kinds of wounds.


### Mental Wounds

These wounds encompass all types of mental trauma, spiritual injury, and weariness of the mind. A biting insult to your character is a mental wound, so is exhaustion from excessive research, and so are fear and confusion.

Mental wounds hinder you on no tests, unless they are major, then they hinder you on all tests. There is no running from your delusions and greatest fears.

While resting, you can mend mental wounds by testing Influence, though not all severities can be mended with all attributes.

- **Minor mental wounds can be mended by Influence with any Approach.**
- **Moderate mental wounds can be mended by Influence with Vigor and Intuition but not by Reason.** Some sense of genuine compassion or at least a warming presence is required for these troubles.
- **Major mental wounds can only be mended by Influence with Intuition.** Heartfelt empathy is required to tackle these troubles.


### Social Wounds

These wounds encompass all types of debts, societal rejection, accusations and other injuries to your reputation. The result of a successful slander campaign is a social wound, so is seclusion (willing or otherwise) from larger society, and so are debts, and being covered in muck.

Social wounds hinder you on Influence and Resource tests. A horrendous reputation is an uphill battle wherever you might want to make yourself heard and being cut off from the currents of society strains your access to all its marvels.

While resting in a settlement, you can mend social wounds with Resource tests, though not all severities can be mended with all attributes.

- **Minor social wounds can be mended by Resources with any Approach.**
- **Moderate social wounds can be mended by Resources with Vigor and Reason but not by Intuition.** Fame, Wealth, rigorous bookkeeping, or a sound argument before a court are required to get out of these predicaments.
- **Major social wounds can only be mended by Resources with Vigor.** Nobility, a made name, or chests of gold are required to get out of these predicaments.


## Stress

Each of your wound slots has **6** stress boxes that you can mark to absorb stress you suffer. Each box has a corresponding number which denotes how much stress than box absorbs when you mark it. You have **3** boxes which may absorb **1** stress each, **2** boxes which may absorb up to **2** stress each, and **2** box which may absorb up to **3** stress.

Whenever you suffer stress, mark an empty box in the corresponding wound slot, noting that it absorbed that stress. Stress you suffer must be entirely absorbed by a single box, you may not distribute stress between boxes.

Should you not have an empty box to absorb stress you suffered, you are in deep trouble.
You may spend Iron equal to the stress you suffered to get a new trait with rating equal to the amount of Iron spent which absorbs the stress for you. Name the trait to describe the permanent injury you suffered and escaped by a hair's breadth.
Otherwise, whatever has been gnawing at you, finally overwhelms you. Be it blood loss, drowning, permanent imprisonment, succumbing to sickness, execution, madness, or complete social ostracism, and you must retire your character.


## Wound Severities

The wound in a wound slot has a severity of **1** (minor), **2** (moderate), or **3** (major) depending on the highest stress box marked in it.

You can reduce the severity of your wounds by tending to them (see [Recovering](../playing-the-game/resting#recovering)). When a wound's severity changes to **0**, it vanishes.


### Minor Wounds

A wound is minor if the highest marked stress box in its slot is **1.**

These wounds are minor inconveniences. Superficial cuts, bruised egos, a revolting appearance after days of adventuring, and similar troubles, that arise with living an interesting life, are minor wounds. Nothing that cannot heal or mend with even just a little resting.

As a simple test's difficulty is always at least **1** and most foes you will encounter will be armed, so these kinds of wounds are more nuisance than hindrance (unless they begin to pile up and fill your wound slots).


### Moderate Wounds

A wound is moderate if highest marked stress box in its slot is **2.**

These wounds are moderate setbacks. Flesh wounds, enduring exhaustion, nightmare-inducing disturbances, being accused of a crime, and similar troubles are moderate wounds.


### Major Wounds

A wound is major if the **3** stress box is marked.

These wounds are grievous injuries which threaten to fester and prematurely end your journey should they not get immediate attention. Stab wounds to the gut, feverish sickness, debilitating delusions, complete ostracization, and similar threats to your character's life are major wounds.
