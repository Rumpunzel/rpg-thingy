# Traits

A **Trait** is a word or phrase that describes something special about a person, place, thing, situation, or group. Almost anything you can think of can have traits. A person might be the `Legendary Blademaster from the Far East` or a room might be `On Fire` after you knock over an oil lamp. Traits let you change the story in ways that go along with your character’s tendencies, skills, or problems.

Traits may be descriptions...

{: .important-title }
Legendary Blademaster from the Far East

{: .important-title }
Sprawling Harbor Town

...or phrases regularly thought, said, or embodied by or about what they are describing.

{: .important-title }
"The traitor who killed my father must die."

{: .important-title }
"BY THE POWER OF GRAYSKULL, I HAVE THE POWER!"

A trait has a rating ranging from **1** to **3** (very rarely there might be traits with even higher rating). Most traits you will encounter will have a rating of **1.**



# Favor

**Favor** is a meta-currency you can spend to influence your dice rolls, tilt luck in your favor, bite through the pain, or sometimes even fuel powerful magic.  

You spend Favor — which you keep track of with coins, glass beads, poker chips, or some other tokens — to unlock the power of traits and make them help you (see [Using Character Traits](#using-character-traits-to-your-advantage)).

You earn Favor by letting a character aspect be compelled against you to complicate the situation or make your life harder (see [Using Traits to your Detriment](#using-character-traits-to-your-detriment)).  
Whenever one of your traits really come out through how you roleplay your character or through the drama that results from your choices, you earn **1** Favor for your character.

Be sure to keep track of the Favor you have left at the end of the session as you start the next session with the Favor with which you ended this session.



# Environmental Traits

Traits describing the environment are discussed in detail in [Interacting with the World](../playing-the-game/interacting-with-the-world).



# Character Traits

Character traits are on your character sheet, such as your [Crucible](#the-crucible) and [Pyre](#the-pyre). They describe personality traits, important details about your past, relationships you have with others, important titles you possess, problems you’re dealing with or goals you’re working toward, or reputations and obligations you carry. These traits only change under very unusual circumstances; most never will.

A character may have a nice beard but if he has the `Magnificient Beard` trait, he has such a great beard, you may use it to your benefit and even to your detriment for dramatic effect.

By taking a trait, a player signals to the group that they are interested in that particular part of the story or their character. The higher the rating of your trait, the more they want the trait to come up in the game. Consider this when choosing your own traits. Think about what you want to experience during the game and try to model your character's traits after the goal.

{: .important }
> Maro has the trait `Exiled Sellsword of Gantha` with a rating of **2.** By taking this trait, he let the group know quite a bit about what he wanted to experience with his character. His character is a sellsword, so he will mostly likely want to invoke the trait during fights. His character is also from a place called Gantha from which he has been exiled. By putting both of these aspects of his character into one trait, he also signals that those two stories are somehow interconnected.
>
> He could have also split the trait in two such as `Exile of Gantha` and `Famed Sellsword` and given them different ratings, had one aspect been more important to him than the other or if they had nothing or little to do with each other in the story.


## Using Character Traits to your Advantage

When you test a skill, you may use **1** of your traits if the trait is relevant to your current task, and it would sense for it to help you. For example, if you try to hit someone with your sword, and you have a trait named `Legendary Blademaster from the Far East`, naturally, you may use it.

You may only use a single of your traits per test. If you have multiple traits which might fit, you have to choose only one of them.

When you use a trait in this way, choose one of the following effects:

- Apply the dice modifier of the [Attribute](attributes) with which you are testing (see [Dice Modifiers](attributes#dice-modifiers))
- During a [Contest](../playing-the-game/skill-tests#contests), use your [Disposition](attributes#disposition) to influence how well your opponent can defend

If the trait you use has a rating of **2** or higher you may choose a number of effects equal to the trait's rating. If you have already chosen to apply your attribute's dice modifier, you may use an additional dice modifier of a different attribute on that roll as well. You choose which of the two other dice modifiers you want to use.

If the trait you use has a rating of **3,** alternatively, you may use it to _only_ apply your attribute's dice modifier or disposition without spending Favor.

{: .important }
> Cyrene has the trait `Drunkard` with a rating of **1.**
>
> During a drinking competition, she spends **1** Favor and uses her `Drunkard` trait to explode the two **6s** she rolled, which, in the end, gives her just the edge she needs to emerge victorious.


## Using Character Traits to your Detriment

There are many reasons to use one of your traits to your detriment. It leads to great roleplaying moments, it lets you communicate who your character is and what their flaws are, it's fun, and it earns you Favor.  

During a [Challenge](../playing-the-game/skill-tests#challenges), you may add one of your trait's rating to the difficulty, if it would make sense said trait would hinder you at what you are trying to achieve.

You may use any of your traits to your detriment, as long as it makes sense that the trait would in some way hinder you.

You may use a single trait only to either help or hinder you, not both. Also, as above, you may only use a single of your traits per test to hinder you. If you have multiple traits which might fit, you have to choose only one of them.

When you do, you gain Favor equal to the trait's rating. Alternatively, the GM may suggest one of your traits to be used to your detriment when it would be both appropriate and dramatic. You may decline to do so by spending Favor equal to the trait's rating.

{: .important }
> When Cyrene tries to balance across a raging river, her `Drunkard` trait hinders her, and she adds **1** to the difficulty, which results in her falling into the water where the river drags her downstream instead of succeeding.  
> However, the whole debacle netted her **1** Favor.

Additionally, you may increase the difficulty of your tests to gain additional benefits should you succeed (see [Creating Boons Using Traits](../playing-the-game/boons-&-banes#creating-boons--banes)).



# To Forge a Gauntlet

People are the very heart of this roleplaying game. Their struggles, their virtues, their faults, and their relationships; in short: their stories.  
There are also battles, monsters, intrigue, and treasure, but they only matter in their relation to people. Who would care about a monster that scares no one, who about a treasure that no one wants, who about a throne in a kingdom without people?

Your character is one of these people, but they matter more than any of the others because through them, you influence the world. They are your metaphorical hand in the fictional world. But in a way, they are also how you experience this fictional world. A world that is dangerous, awe-inspiring, and full of people who are convinced just as you are that they are the hero of this (or at least their) story.

Though you actually are the hero of this story. And that is no light responsibility to bear. They — and, by proxy, you — are the heart of all the drama. To you, there is no monsters more important than the one that most scares your character and no treasure more precious than the one they covet most. So your characters needs something to care about, something that motivates them to put themselves in harm's way. And they need something to terrify them, something they dare not even look at for there seems no way to overcome it.

The Forge Gauntlet calls these Crucible and Pyre. A crucible to contain your story and the fire to smelt the prizes of the gauntlet, and the tribulations your character endures to forge a gauntlet for that metaphorical hand of yours. To forge a story wroth remembering. And who knows, perhaps we might even grow a little with them.


## The Crucible

Your character's Crucible is one of two special traits at the center of your character's identity. It is something about your character or something they believe about themself or the world, which is objectively true.

The Crucible you formulate for your character is incredibly useful for your fellow players. It tells everyone at the table what you want to do with your character. If your Crucible is `Patriarch of the Goldwyn family`, then that is not up to question; you are the patriarch of the Goldwyn family, and it's what you were born to be.

It describes what is most central to your character and as such, it is a container for their story.
If your Crucible is `Legendary Blademaster from the Far East`, then both the fact that your character is a legendary blademaster and that they are from a distant land frame their entire story. Even if the heart of their story is about something else entirely, such as negotiating peace or becoming a world-renown chef.

The sign of a good Crucible is that whenever you find yourself in a dire situation or unsure what to do next, you can look at your character sheet, and it nudges you into the right direction, even against your better judgement.

A Crucible always has a rating of at least **2.**

## The Pyre

Your character's Pyre is the other special trait at the center of your character's identity. Though, it also describes something about your character or something they believe about themselves or the world, your character's differs from all other kinds of traits in the game as this one is not objectively true. To be more precise, it comes in two different flavors:

### The False Conviction

A conviction your character believes to be true, wittingly or unwittingly, though it is a delusion, a self-deception or misjudgement about their surroundings that you, the player, _know_ to be incorrect.

The central questions such a Pyre poses are:

- How will the character learn?
- What will it take?
- Where will it take them?
- Will they find the courage to face the truth when push comes to shove?

Some examples are:

{: .important-title }
There is no nobler goal than to give my life for Order of the Silver Falcon

{: .important-title }
"I must recapture the Avatar to restore my honor!"

### The Quest

A conjecture about your character that might or might not be true. Neither your character nor you know if it true or not and you are aching to undergo a quest to confront yourself and find out what is true.

A Pyre that is a conjecture is often _possibly_ true and the character's journey will consist of them proving that they were right to believe so from the start or learn the hard way that they were mistaken.

The central questions such a Pyre poses are:
- Is this true about the character?
- Is this who they are?
- Is this where they belong?

Some examples are:

{: .important-title }
Not brave enough for the dangerous world out there

{: .important-title }
"The traitor who killed my father must die."

The sign of a good Crucible is that whenever you find yourself in a moment of peace and quiet, you can look at your character sheet, and it tears you back into chaos and adventure, most likely against your better judgement.

Just as your character's Crucible, their Pyre always has a rating of at least **2.**


## The Path of Pyre

As you can see, the same phrase can be used either as a Crucible or a Pyre, though its meaning drastically shifts. As a Crucible, `"The traitor who killed my father must die."` is a goal your character has that they will either fulfill or die trying. As a Pyre, it is meant to be challenged as the story progresses. Does he indeed deserve to die? What did my father do that he was betrayed and murdered? Am I at fault for my father's death? These are all questions that only result from a Pyre, for they are meant to be challenged, not from a Crucible.

The Crucible is what contains your story. It is what will drive them to press on when everything else tells them to give in. It is the core of their identity to hold onto when things get tough.

The Pyre is what boils underneath the surface, which brings chaos and unrest to what the Crucible tries to contain. It molds the story which you will experience to forge the gauntlet your character will have to endure.

Your character's Pyre aches to be resolved and throughout play.  
When you do, kindle a new Pyre or retire your character, as they have arrived at the end of their journey.

You will find that Pyre takes one of three paths.

### Reborn from the Ashes

You face the Pyre, and it reveals the truths you held dear to be but shadows leading you astray. It burns away your false convictions, your delusions, and you emerge anew.

Adjust your Crucible to reflect the lesson your character has learned.

### Tempered in the Flame

You followed the Pyre, and it led you where you would have never thought you could have arrived at all. You were right all along, through all the trials and tribulations.

Incorporate your Pyre into your Crucible as your characters embraces who they were always meant to be and forges truth out of dreams.

### Burnt and Scarred

When you looked upon the raging Pyre, everything screamed within you. When you touched it, it burnt you with scars you will carry until the end of your days. No more. Not ever again. There is no sense in any of this.

Replace your Crucible with your Pyre as your character doubles down on their delusions and false convictions and forges truth out of nightmares.


## The Goal

At the start of each session, write a trait to represent the goal for your character to achieve during that session. Try to include _what_ you want to achieve as well as a rough idea of _how_ and _why_ your character is eager to complete that goal.

At the end of each session, if you have achieved your goal, mark **1** **XP** for any of your skills.

Your goals have a rating of **1.**
