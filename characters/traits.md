# Traits

A trait is a word or phrase that describes something special about a person, place, thing, situation, or group. Almost anything you can think of can have traits. A person might be the `Legendary Blademaster from the Far East` or a room might be `On Fire` after you knock over an oil lamp. Traits let you change the story in ways that go along with your character’s tendencies, skills, or problems.

Traits may be descriptions...

{: .important-title }
Legendary Blademaster from the Far East

{: .important-title }
Sprawling Harbor Town

...or phrases regularly thought, said, or embodied by or about what they are describing.

{: .important-title }
"The traitor who killed my father must die."

{: .important-title }
"BY THE POWER OF GRAYSKULL, I HAVE THE POWER!"

A trait has a rating ranging from **1** to **3** (very rarely there might be traits with even higher rating). Most traits you will encounter will have a rating of **1.**


## Environmental Traits

Traits describing the environment are discussed in detail in [Interacting with the World](../playing-the-game/interacting-with-the-world).


## Character Traits

Character traits are on your character sheet, such as your [Crucible](forging-the-gauntlet#the-crucible) and [Pyre](forging-the-gauntlet#the-pyre). They describe personality traits, important details about your past, relationships you have with others, important titles you possess, problems you’re dealing with or goals you’re working toward, or reputations and obligations you carry. These traits only change under very unusual circumstances; most never will.

A character may have a nice beard but if he has the `Magnificient Beard` trait, he has such a great beard, you may use it to your benefit and even to your detriment for dramatic effect.

You have a total of **6** character traits: your Crucible and Pyre (each with a rating of **2**), **3** traits of your choice and a trait representing your current [Goal](#your-goal) (each with a rating of **1**).

By taking a trait, a player signals to the group that they are interested in that particular part of the story or their character. The higher the rating of your trait, the more they want the trait to come up in the game. Consider this when choosing your own traits. Think about what you want to experience during the game and try to model your character's traits after the goal.

{: .important }
> Maro has the trait `Exiled Sellsword of Gantha` with a rating of **2.** By taking this trait, he let the group know quite a bit about what he wanted to experience with his character. His character is a sellsword, so he will mostly likely want to invoke the trait during fights. His character is also from a place called Gantha from which he has been exiled. By putting both of these aspects of his character into one trait, he also signals that those two stories are somehow interconnected.
>
> He could have also split the trait in two such as `Exile of Gantha` and `Famed Sellsword` and given them different ratings, had one aspect been more important to him than the other or if they had nothing or little to do with each other in the story.

### Your Goal

At the start of each session, write a trait to represent the goal for your character to achieve during that session. Try to include _what_ you want to achieve as well as a rough idea of _how_ and _why_ your character is eager to complete that goal.

When you achieve your goal, you gain Favor equal to your goal's rating and mark **1** **XP** for any of your skills. Then choose a new goal to achieve.

Your goal has a rating of **1.**


## Favor

**Favor** is a meta-currency you can spend to influence your dice rolls, tilt luck in your favor, bite through the pain, or sometimes even fuel powerful magic.

You spend Favor — which you keep track of with coins, glass beads, poker chips, or some other tokens — to unlock the power of traits and make them help you (see [Using Character Traits](#using-your-traits-to-your-advantage)).

You earn Favor by letting a character aspect be compelled against you to complicate the situation or make your life harder (see [Using Traits to your Detriment](#using-your-traits-to-your-detriment)).  
Whenever one of your traits really come out through how you roleplay your character or through the drama that results from your choices, you earn **1** Favor for your character.

Be sure to keep track of the Favor you have left at the end of the session as you start the next session with the Favor with which you ended this session.


## Using your Traits to your Advantage

When you test a skill, you may use **1** of your traits if the trait is relevant to your current task, and it would sense for it to help you. For example, if you try to hit someone with your sword, and you have a trait named `Legendary Blademaster from the Far East`, naturally, you may use it.

You may only use a single of your traits per test. If you have multiple traits which might fit, you have to choose only one of them.

When you want to use a trait in this way, spend **1** Favor and choose one of the following effects:

- Apply the dice modifier of the [Attribute](attributes) with which you are testing (see [Dice Modifiers](attributes#dice-modifiers))
- During a [Contest](../playing-the-game/skill-tests#contests), use your [Disposition](attributes#disposition) to influence how well your opponent can defend

If the trait you use has a rating of **2** or higher you may choose a number of effects equal to the trait's rating. If you have already chosen to apply your attribute's dice modifier, you may use an additional dice modifier of a different attribute on that roll as well. You choose which of the two other dice modifiers you want to use.

If the trait you use has a rating of **3,** alternatively, you may use it to _only_ apply your attribute's dice modifier or disposition without spending Favor.

{: .important }
> Cyrene has the trait `Drunkard` with a rating of **1.**
>
> During a drinking competition, she spends **1** Favor and uses her `Drunkard` trait to explode the two **6s** she rolled, which, in the end, gives her just the edge she needs to emerge victorious.


## Using your Traits to your Detriment

There are many reasons to use one of your traits to your detriment. It leads to great roleplaying moments, it lets you communicate who your character is and what their flaws are, it's fun, and it earns you Favor.  

During a [Challenge](../playing-the-game/skill-tests#challenges), you may add one of your trait's rating to the difficulty, if it would make sense said trait would hinder you at what you are trying to achieve.

You may use any of your traits to your detriment, as long as it makes sense that the trait would in some way hinder you.

You may use a single trait only to either help or hinder you, not both. Also, as above, you may only use a single of your traits per test to hinder you. If you have multiple traits which might fit, you have to choose only one of them.

When you do, you gain Favor equal to the trait's rating. Alternatively, the GM may suggest one of your traits to be used to your detriment when it would be both appropriate and dramatic. You may decline to do so by spending Favor equal to the trait's rating.

{: .important }
> When Cyrene tries to balance across a raging river, her `Drunkard` trait hinders her, and she adds **1** to the difficulty, which results in her falling into the water where the river drags her downstream instead of succeeding.  
> However, the whole debacle netted her **1** Favor.

Additionally, you may increase the difficulty of your tests to gain additional benefits should you succeed (see [Creating Boons Using Traits](../playing-the-game/boons-&-banes#creating-boons--banes)).
