# Traits

A **Trait** is a factual description about what makes your character extraordinary with mechanical weight.

A character may have a nice beard but if he has the `Magnificient Beard` trait, he has such a great beard, you may use it to your benefit and even to your detriment for dramatic effect.

A trait has a rating ranging from **1** to **3.**

By taking a trait, a player signals to the group that they are interested in that particular part of the story or their character. The higher the rating of your trait, the more they want the trait to come up in the game. Consider this when choosing your own traits. Think about what you want to experience during the game and try to model your character's traits after the goal.

{: .important }
> Maro has the trait `Exiled Sellsword of Gantha` with a rating of **2.** By taking this trait, he let the group know quite a bit about what he wanted to experience with his character. His character is a sellsword, so he will mostly likely want to invoke the trait during fights. His character is also from a place called Gantha from which he has been exiled. By putting both of these aspects of his character into one trait, he also signals that those two stories are somehow interconnected.
>
> He could have also split the trait in two such as `Exile of Gantha` and `Famed Sellsword` and given them different ratings, had one aspect been more important to him than the other or if they had nothing or little to do with each other in the story.



## Using Traits for Dice Modifiers

When you test a skill, you may use one of your traits to unlock the dice modifier of the attribute with which you are testing (see [Dice Modifiers](attributes#dice-modifiers))

After you use a trait this way, mark it. Traits with marks equal to their rating can no longer be used once until you [Rest](../playing-the-game/resting) and clear all marks on your traits. So traits with rating **2** may be used twice and traits with rating **3** thrice before you need to rest.

You may only use a single of your traits per test. If you have multiple traits which might fit, you have to choose only one of them.


## Using Traits to your Detriment

There are many reasons to use one of your traits to your detriment. It leads to great roleplaying moments, it lets you communicate who your character is and what their flaws are, it's fun, and it earns you more **XP.**  
During a [Simple Test](../playing-the-game/skill-tests/simple-tests.md), you may add one of your trait's rating to the difficulty, if it would make sense said trait would hinder you at what you are trying to achieve.

You may use any of your traits to your detriment, as long as it makes sense that the trait would in some way hinder you.

You may only use a trait to either help or hinder you, not both. Also, as above, you may only use a single of your traits per test to hinder you. If you have multiple traits which might fit, you have to choose only one of them.

This will result in you gaining **XP,** if you fail the test.  
Additionally, this might gain you additional benefits should you succeed (see [Creating Boons Using Traits](../playing-the-game/boons-&-banes#using-traits)).

The GM may suggest one of your traits to be used to your detriment when it would be both appropriate and dramatic. You may decline to do so by spending **1** Favor. If you accept, use the trait to your detriment as you normally would.

> When Cyrene tries to balance across a raging river, her `Drunkard` trait hinders her, and she adds **1** to the difficulty, which results in her falling into the water where the river drags her downstream instead of succeeding.  
> However, the whole debacle netted her **1** **XP.**
