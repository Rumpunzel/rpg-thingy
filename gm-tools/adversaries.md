# Adversaries

Adversaries gain no Favor.



# Simplifying

Adversaries can be constructed with the same detail as PCs, though in almost all cases, they can be greatly abstracted to achieve the same impact, if not improve it and make your life as a GM easier along the way.

## Dice Modifiers

In general, dice modifiers can be completely omitted for basically all adversaries (though important foes may still utilize them to increase their threat level).

## Traits

As an adversary's traits are not used for dice modifiers, instead they may be used for minimum effort. Adversaries should have a limited number of adversaries and even fewer of them high rated. High rated traits make adversaries incredibly dangerous to face ill-prepared.  
Adversary traits are marked with an approach and a skill to indicate in which context they excel. In any other context, an adversary's trait grant only **1** minimum effort.

## Assets

Most of the time keeping of track adversaries is enough work without keeping track of a handful of asset quality ratings on top. Instead of assets, adversaries use their traits for minimum effort, so they have no need for them.  
Unless attrition is vital for the adversary to be interesting, replace assets with lower rated traits.

> Down in the sewers, Cyrene manages a nice hit against a ghoul by exploiting its `Light Sensitivity` trait with rating **1** but the vile beast does not abandon its nest so easily and jumps past Cyrene's torch, clawing at her face. The ghoul rolls terribly, but it has the trait `Festering Fangs & Claws` with a rating of **2,** which work as a weapon on its Vigor attacks, so Cyrene will have to roll **2** successes to evade. She invokes the `Light Sensitivity` trait again to aid with her defense roll and, thankfully, she rolls **2** successes and survives unscathed to fight another round.
