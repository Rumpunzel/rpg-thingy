# Approaches

Each character has the three following different Approaches. Each Approach represents a different way forward in the narrative when it comes to confronting a problem. Each character has a numerical rating associated with each Approach. This rating determines how many dice that character will roll when they face a problem with that Approach.

Each Aspect also has a unique Dice Modifier that changes a few things about dice are rolled and a [Disposition](#Disposition) which gives you and edge when engaging someone else in a contest.

## Vigor

Vigor encompasses strength, both of body and mind; endurance; tenacity; ferocity; panache; and power of will.

</figure>

It is the most direct approach. It's a matter of facing problems head-on, courageous, and with conviction always at your side. A matter of going all out to win it and to win big. As such, it is the Approach most closely linked to the control and harnessing of fiery emotions.

You approach a challenge with Vigor whenever you swing your mighty axe in a blinded rage, whenever you embolden your compatriots with a fiery speech, whenever you weave a heart-breaking tune on your lyre, or whenever remain calm even in the face of a terrifying acid-spewing monstrosity.

**Dice Modifier:** For every die whose face comes up as a 6, roll an additional die. If that additional die also comes up a 6, it explodes as well. Continue this process until you have rolled an additional die for each 6 you've rolled.


## Intuition

Intuition encompasses flexibility, both of body and mind; nimbleness; guile; reflexes; wit; cleverness; and empathy.

<figure style="float: right; margin-right: 0">
  <img width="320" src="https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/2dcd94db-2dd4-40de-a9f4-f141f6967120/d2nouiz-8a1c5eac-1540-4086-93ab-eabbd38df6e2.jpg/v1/fill/w_900,h_660,q_75,strp/duelist_by_pictishscout_d2nouiz-fullview.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7ImhlaWdodCI6Ijw9NjYwIiwicGF0aCI6IlwvZlwvMmRjZDk0ZGItMmRkNC00MGRlLWE5ZjQtZjE0MWY2OTY3MTIwXC9kMm5vdWl6LThhMWM1ZWFjLTE1NDAtNDA4Ni05M2FiLWVhYmJkMzhkZjZlMi5qcGciLCJ3aWR0aCI6Ijw9OTAwIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmltYWdlLm9wZXJhdGlvbnMiXX0.TvBmviwiz3t_Pi2_3BpBJ68kUNV7TEVdmy_KkW9MySk" alt="Caleb">
  <figcaption>A duelist flourishing his rapier with Intuition.</figcaption>
</figure>



It is the most reactive approach. It's a matter of facing problems in the moment and with the element of surprise always on your side. A matter of tipping the scales in your favour by anticipating the future and going with the flow.

You approach a challenge with Intuition whenever you swirl your blade like a derwish, whenever you outfox your enemies with your silver tongue, whenever you know exactly the right thing to say in the face of defeat, whenever you escape disaster by a hair's breadth without breaking a sweat.

**Dice Modifier:** For every die whose face comes up as a 1, you roll it again. If that die comes up a 1 again, repeat this process. Continue this until there are no 1's left in your pool.


## Reason

Reason encompasses precision, both of body and mind; deftness; intellect; foresight; industriousness; and rigor.

<figure style="float: right; margin-right: 0">
  <img width="320" src="https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/2dcd94db-2dd4-40de-a9f4-f141f6967120/d4q16hd-655fa537-d9ec-4354-9625-652ce3cf2cc2.jpg/v1/fill/w_900,h_1244,q_75,strp/yeoman_by_pictishscout_d4q16hd-fullview.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7ImhlaWdodCI6Ijw9MTI0NCIsInBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcLzJkY2Q5NGRiLTJkZDQtNDBkZS1hOWY0LWYxNDFmNjk2NzEyMFwvZDRxMTZoZC02NTVmYTUzNy1kOWVjLTQzNTQtOTYyNS02NTJjZTNjZjJjYzIuanBnIiwid2lkdGgiOiI8PTkwMCJ9XV0sImF1ZCI6WyJ1cm46c2VydmljZTppbWFnZS5vcGVyYXRpb25zIl19.4B24FK2YxKoPMV_RKkno1eptsmVeqUgSBX09wg_QhvE" alt="Crossbowman">
  <figcaption>An archer scrutinizing his surroundings with Reason.</figcaption>
</figure>


It is the most thoughtful approach. It's a matter of facing problems on your own terms and with a contigency plan always by your side. A matter of knowing your enemies, their blindspots, and taking the time to masterfully exploit them.

You approach a challenge with Reason whenever you fell the rider approaching from the horizon with a single arrow, whenever you facilitate genuine understanding between warring parties, whenever doom misses you by a mile as you were expecting it, whenever you find yourself in a race with fate one step ahead.

**Dice Modifier:** After the dice have been cast, you may ignore the result and roll all dice again.


## Disposition

These Approaches do not form the foundation of only your character. The scoundrel ambushes you in the gloomy ally, the moonlit lord anticipates your every move, even passive obstacles such as a river's current might roar with ferocity. When you create your character you have the choice between two different dispositions, a representation of how your characters engages with his surroundings.

Your Disposition may force your target to perfectly defend against you. Which means, during Conflicts they may only defend themself but not their team's Morale when defending with an Approach against which your chosen Approach is positively dispositioned.

Your disposition represents a certain knack you have against the other approaches, a weakness you might exploit. But beware, for your enemies also have dispositions!

#### Disposition I

**Reason must defend perfectly against your Vigor:** You are a force too overwhelming, your attacks are too mighty, your speeches are too gripping, they cannot be faced with a cool demeanour for you leave no demeanour cool.

**Vigor must defend perfectly against your Intuition:** You change course too deftly, your attacks are a stunning barrage, your lies are too tricky a web to navigate, they cannot be faced head-on with brute force for you bend like grass in the wind.

**Intuition must defend perfectly against your Reason:** Your plans are too well thought out, your attacks are too precise, your rhetorical traps are too sophisticated, they cannot be weaseled out of for you have thought of everything.

#### Disposition II

**Intuition must defend perfectly against your Vigor:** You are a force too overwhelming, your attacks are too mighty, your speeches are too gripping, they cannot be faced with the cowardice of a weasel for you leave no place left to hide.

**Reason must defend perfectly against your Intuition:** You change course too deftly, your attacks are a stunning barrage, your lies are too tricky a web to navigate, they cannot be faced with a cool demeanour for they still think about your last move while your are crossing the finish line.

**Vigor must defend perfectly against your Reason:** Your plans are too well thought out, your attacks are too precise, your rhetorical traps are too sophisticated, they cannot be faced head-on with brute force for every careless step spells disaster.

# Skills

Skills represent an area of expertise, something a character may or may not be trained or even an expert in.

There are **6** Skills in total (see [Skill List](#Skill-List)).

A skill has a corresponding number denoting the character's training. The default is **6.** This number denotes what is the lowest number on a die that counts as a success when that character rolls that skill.

A **6** in a Skill means a character is untrained.

# Traits

A Trait is a factual description about what makes your character extraordinary with mechanical weight. He may have a nice beard but if he has the `Magnificient Beard` Trait, he has such a great beard, you may use it to your benefit and even to your detriment to gain [Favor](Favor).

A Trait has a rating, usually ranging from **1** to **3.**


## Using Traits to your Benefit

When you test a skill, you may spend **1** Favor to invoke one of your Traits to re-roll **1** of the dice of your roll. Per test, you may invoke a Trait a number of times up to the rating of the Trait. Per test, you may only invoke a single of your Traits per test. If you have multiple Traits which might fit, you have to choose only one of them.

Traits with extraordinary high ratings (normally this means rating **3**) may let you re-roll a number of dice (as shown below) for free without spending Favor.

| **Trait Rating** |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  | 10  |
|:----------------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|  **Free Dice**   |  -  |  -  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  2  |  3  |  3  |  4  |  4  |

So if you want to use a Trait with rating **3** to help you, you may re-roll **1** die for free and may spend up to **2** Favor to re-roll up to **2** more.


> Cyrene has the Trait `Drunkard` with a rating of **1.**
>
> During a drinking competition, she invokes it to re-roll **1** of her dice, which, in the end, gives her just the edge she needs to emerge victorious.


## Using Traits to your Detriment

There are many reasons to use one of your Traits to your detriment. It can lead to great roleplaying moments, it can let you communicate who your character and their flaws are, it can be simply for fun, and it can lead to you earning more Favor for later use.

You may use any of your Traits to your detriment, both against static obstacles and in Contests and Conflicts, as long as it makes sense that the Trait would in some way hinder you.

You may only use a Trait to either help or hinder you, not both.

---

### Against Static Obstacles

When you test with a skill against a static obstacle, you may add one of your Trait's rating to the obstacle, if it would make sense that said Trait would hinder you at what you are trying to achieve. This might increase the amount of Favor you will receive should you fail the test.

The GM may compel you to use one of your Traits to your detriment when it would be both appropriate and dramatic when testing against a static obstacle. You may decline the compel by spending Favor equal to the Trait's rating. If you accept, use the Trait to your detriment as you normally would.


> When Cyrene tries to balance across a raging river, her `Drunkard` Trait hinders her, and she adds **1** to the
> obstacle, which results in her falling into the water and gaining additional Favor instead of succeeding.

---

### During Contests & Conflicts

Alternatively, when you test with a skill in a Contest or Conflict, you may also use a fitting Trait to your detriment. Though, in most cases, your opponent will be the one to do so first.

In a Contest or Conflict, instead of increasing an obstacle, using a Trait to your detriment in this context, lets your opponent add your Trait's rating as dice to their roll.

When one of your Traits is used against you in a Contest of Conflict, you may spend **1** Favor to reduce the number of dice you give your opponent by **1.** You may do this a number of times equal to the Trait's rating until you no longer give your opponent any dice.


> During a kerfuffle at court, Cyrene tries to embarrass one of the guests she has met before (when he crossed her during a previous adventure). She only manages **1** success on her roll, though he manages none at all, he invokes Cyrene's `Drunkard` Trait against her to add **1** die to his roll. Cyrene may now spend **1** Favor to not give him that additional die, but she wants to see what will happen and decides against it.
>
> The obnoxious guest manages to roll a success on his additional die and turns the outcome into a tie, which he, as defender, wins. The court is now laughing at Cyrene, as he deflects her insults right back into her face. What a windbag. At least she received **1** Favor from her **1** success.


## Signaling

By taking a Trait, a player signals to the group that they are interested in that particular part of the story or their character. The higher the rating of your Trait, the more they want the Trait to come up in the game. Consider this when choosing your own Traits. Think about what you want to experience during the game and try to model your character's Traits after the goal.


> Maro has the Trait `Exiled Sellsword of Gantha` with a rating of **2.** By taking this Trait, he let the group know quite a bit about what he wanted to experience with his character. His character is a sellsword, so he will mostly likely want to invoke the Trait during fights. His character is also from a place called Gantha from which he has been exiled. By putting both of these aspects of his character into one Trait, he also signals that those two stories are somehow interconnected.
>
> He could have also split the Trait in two such as `Exile of Gantha` and `Famed Sellsword` and given them different ratings, had one aspect been more important to him than the other or if they had nothing or little to do with each other in the story.


## Traits as Knowledge & Experience

If you have a Trait, openly known Traits of places, creatures, or people connected to your area of expertise. You may ask the GM for this at any time, and you are invited to enrich the world with your descriptions of your character's experience any time you see fit.

Even if you don't have a fitting Trait, all superficial or incomplete knowledge, rough outlines big events is always available to you.

You may also spend Favor on a Trait representing your experience or familiarity to create a mechanical advantage for you (mostly in the form of revealing new Traits). The better your rating, the more detailed, obscure information you may create or discover.

Alternatively, you may spend **1** Favor on a Trait to gain a Preparation with rating **1** representing something you would always carry with you considering the experience that Trait represents.


> During their last adventure, Mare and Cyrene have crossed path with the robber king of Gantha and Maro got swept up in his character's past and now this robber king spells quite a bit of trouble. Though, as an `Exiled Sellsword of Gantha`, there is for sure something Maro knows about this robber king that might aid them in their struggle.

---

### Discovering Traits

Depending on the rating of your Trait, different kinds of information are available to you:

- **Rating 1:** All openly known Traits and the highest Approach (if applicable) of all places, creatures, or people connected to the Trait, as well as its best Skill (if applicable) and its Disposition (if applicable).
- **Rating 2:** In-depth knowledge of the most common subject areas; rough outlines of obscure facts; all secret Traits with a rating of **1** and the two highest Approaches (if applicable) of all places, creatures, or people connected to the Trait, as well as its two best Skills (if applicable) and its Disposition (if applicable).
- **Rating 3+:** Expert at the topic; solid knowledge of even obscure facts and occurrences; all secret Traits with a rating less than your Trait's rating and all Approaches (if applicable) of all places, creatures, or people connected to the Trait, as well as its three best Skills (if applicable) and its Disposition (if applicable).


> As Maro's Trait `Exiled Sellsword of Gantha` has a rating of **2,** he knows of the robber king's two highest Approaches are Reason and Intuition, as well as that both are higher than his.
>
> Fortunately, he also learns of the robber king's secret Trait `Only goes out at Night` which has a rating of **1.** It is not much but if he harbors such a secret, perhaps there is more hiding beneath to surface. Time to do some research (see [Research](Resting#research)).

---

### Creating Traits

Alternatively, you may also suggest a new Trait for a place, a creature, or a person connected to one of your own Traits. If the table agrees with your suggestion, you may spend Favor up to the rating of your own Trait and create the new Trait on the place, creature, or person with rating equal to the amount of Insight you spent.

It can also happen that the GM likes your suggestion so much that he adds the Trait (or a variation of it) on his volition, without you having to spend Favor and with the rating of their choosing.


## Legacies

Legacies are special and powerful Traits that are always positive.

The only way to gain Legacies is through surviving a [Last Stand](Conflict#last-stand) during a Conflict. Legacies are always associated with an [Approach](Approaches).

You may invoke a Legacy just like a Trait, though you may invoke both a Trait and a Legacy on the same roll. In addition, when you invoke a Legacy, you also add the associated Approach's dice modifier to that roll. This may allow you to use up to two different dice modifiers on the same roll.


---


# Conditions

Conditions are temporary, negative, but unavoidable consequences of your daring adventures. They are always negative and will get in your way or even help the blackguards who cross your way until you get rid of them.

There are three different types of Conditions (as listed below). When the rules call for an *appropriate Condition,* they reference the different types of Conditions, as not all Conditions will hinder you on every test.

When you test against a static obstacles and if you have an appropriate Condition with rating higher than the test's obstacle, treat the obstacle as if it were the rating of your appropriate Condition with the highest rating.

During Contests and Conflicts, your opponents will use your Conditions to their advantage. For your opponents, your Conditions work like Preparations (though using them does not degrade the Condition's rating), so they may treat any roll they've made for an action that takes advantage of your Condition as at least as many successes as the Condition's rating. You may use your opponents' Conditions in the same way as your opponent's can use yours.

You can reduce the rating of your Conditions by tending to them (see [Resting](Resting) on how to reduce the rating of your Conditions).


## Condition Slots

You have **6** slots for three kinds of different Conditions available. When you receive a new Condition, fill any available, empty slot with rating of at least that Condition's rating. A Condition in a slot always has the slot's rating.

Any of the three different Condition types -- physical, mental, and worldly -- fit into any of your available slots.

When a Condition's rating changes, move it to the according slot, given you have an according, empty slot. When a Condition's rating is reduced to **0** or less, it vanishes.

Should you receive a Condition but do not have any slot to note a Condition of that rating, increase that Conditions rating by **1** and try again until you find a slot with rating of at least that Condition's rating. If you cannot find any empty space to note your Condition, either because the Conditions rating is too high or because you have no more space for more Conditions, you are in deep trouble.

- During Conflicts, you must take a new detrimental Trait to absorb any remaining stress, and you are removed from the Conflict.
- Outside of Conflicts, your fate is even worse. Whatever has been gnawing at you, finally overwhelms you. Be it feverish wounds, madness, or social ostracization, and you must retire your character.

---

You have the following three types of slots for Conditions.

### Minor Conditions (Rating 1)

You have **3** slots available for minor Conditions.

These are minor inconveniences. Superficial cuts, bruised egos, a revolting appearance after days of adventuring, and similar troubles that arise with living an interesting life are minor Conditions. Nothing that cannot heal or mend with even just a little resting.

As a static obstacle's rating is almost always at least **1,** these kinds of Conditions are more of a nuisance than a hindrance (unless they begin to pile up and fill your Condition slots).

---

### Moderate Conditions (Rating 2)

You have **2** slots available for moderate Conditions.

These are moderate setbacks. Flesh wounds, enduring exhaustion, nightmare-inducing disturbances, being accused of a crime, and similar troubles are moderate Conditions.

---

### Major Conditions (Rating 3)

You have **1** slot available for a major Condition.

These are grievous injuries which threaten to fester and prematurely end your journey should they not get immediate attention. Stab wounds to the gut, feverish sickness, debilitating delusions, complete ostracization, and similar threats to your character's life are major Conditions.


## Types of Conditions

There are three types of Conditions: physical, mental, and worldly.

### Physical Conditions

This type of Condition encompasses all types of physical trauma, bodily injury and muscle weariness. A cut from a blade is a physical Condition, so is exhaustion from excessive travelling, and so are sickness and poisoning.

Physical Conditions always will hinder you on Fight, Maneuver, Wilderness, and Craft tests.

Major physical Conditions also hinder you on Influence tests.

Physical Conditions never hinder you on Resource tests.

While resting, you can mend physical Conditions with Craft tests, though not all ratings can be mended by all [Approaches.](Approaches)

- Minor physical Conditions can be mended by Craft with any Approach.
- Moderate physical Conditions can be mended by Craft with Intuition and Reason but not by Vigor.
- Major physical Conditions can only be mended by Craft with Reason.


|                |  Hinders   |     |   Vigor    |    Intuition     | Reason |
|----------------|:----------:|-----|:----------:|:----------------:|:------:|

| **Resources**  |     -      |     |     -      |        -         |   -    |

---

### Mental Conditions

This type of Condition encompasses all types of mental trauma, spiritual injury and weariness of the mind. A biting insult to your character is a physical Condition, so is exhaustion from excessive research, and so are fear and confusion.

Mental Conditions always will hinder you on Influence, Maneuver, and Fight tests.

Major mental Conditions hinder you on all tests. You are never truly safe from your fears.

While resting, you can mend mental Conditions with Influence tests, though not all ratings can be mended with all Approaches.

- Minor mental Conditions can be mended by Influence with any Approach.
- Moderate mental Conditions can be mended by Influence with Vigor and Intuition but not by Reason.
- Major mental Conditions can only be mended by Influence with Intuition.


|                |  Hinders   |     |      Vigor       | Intuition |   Reason   |
|----------------|:----------:|-----|:----------------:|:---------:|:----------:|
| **Influence**  |    All     |     | Minor & Moderate |    All    | Only Minor |
| **Fight**      |    All     |     |        -         |     -     |     -      |
| **Maneuver**   |    All     |     |        -         |     -     |     -      |
| **Wilderness** | Only Major |     |        -         |     -     |     -      |
| **Craft**      | Only Major |     |        -         |     -     |     -      |
| **Resources**  | Only Major |     |        -         |     -     |     -      |

---

### Worldly Conditions

This type of Condition encompasses all types of societal rejection, representational injury and emptiness of the purse. The result of a successful slander campaign is a worldly Condition, so is reclusion (willing or otherwise) from larger society, and so are debts and being covered in muck.

Worldly Conditions always will hinder you on Influence, Craft, and Resource tests.

Major worldly Conditions also hinder you on Wilderness tests.

Worldly Conditions never hinder you on Fight or Maneuver tests.

While resting in a settlement, you can mend worldly Conditions with Resource tests, though not all ratings can be mended with all Approaches.

- Minor worldly Conditions can be mended by Resources with any Approach.
- Moderate worldly Conditions can be mended by Resources with Vigor and Reason but not by Intuition.
- Major worldly Conditions can only be mended by Resources with Vigor.



|                |  Hinders   |     | Vigor | Intuition  |      Reason      |
