# The Heart of rpg-thingy

People are the very heart of this roleplaying game. Their struggles, their virtues, their faults, and their relationships; in short: stories. There are also battles, monsters, intrigue, and treasure, but they only matter in their relation to people. Who would care about a monster that scares no one, who about a treasure that no one wants, who about a throne in a kingdom without people? 

Your character is one of these people, but they matter more than any of the others because through them, you influence the world. But in a way, they are also how you experience the fictional world. A world that is dangerous, awe-inspiring, and full of people who are convinced just as you are that they are the hero of this (or at least their) story.

Though you actually are the hero of this story. And that is no light responsibility to bear. They — and, by proxy, you — are the heart of all the drama. To you, there is no monsters more important than the one that most scare your character and no treasure more precious than the one they covet most. So your characters needs something to care about, something that motivates them to put themselves in harm's way. And they need something to terrify them, something they dare not even look at for there seems no way to overcome it.

rpg-thingy calls these the **Truth** and the **Lie** your character believes. A lie they must grow to face and a truth to keep them pressing on, to forge a story wroth remembering. And who knows, perhaps we might even grow a little with them.


### The Truth

The Truth your characters believes in is an objectively true fact about your character.

You can either phrase it as a statement about your character.

> - The traitor who killed my father must die.
>
> - The Goldwyn family will endure.

Or as a quote of something your character might regularly think or say.

> - "Every one of my friends can rely on me no matter what."
>
> - "BY THE POWER OF GRAYSKULL, I HAVE THE POWER!"

The sign of a good Truth is that whenever you find yourself in a tricky situation or unsure what to do next, you can look at your character sheet, and it nudges you into the right direction.

The Truth you formulate for your character is incredibly useful for your fellow players. It tells everyone at the table what you want to do with your character. If part of your belief is that your character is the `"Patriarch of the Goldwyn family"`, then that is not up to question. The Truth encompasses what your character excels at and who they truly are.

### The Lie

Just like the Truth your character believes in, you can phrase the Lie your they believe either as a statement about them or as something they regularly think or say, though the Lie is not objectively true. To be more precise, it comes in two different flavors:

A conviction your character believes to be true, wittingly or unwittingly, though it is a delusion, a self-deception or misjudgement about their surroundings that you, as a player, know to be incorrect. The central questions such a Lie poses are: How will the character learn? What will it take? Where will it take? Will they find the courage to face the truth when push comes to shove?

> - I owe the Order of the Silver Falcon my life. There is no nobler goal than to give my life to repay my debt. 
>
> - I have left my life as a mercenary behind me. Is now a well-adjusted, productive member of society.

A conjecture about your character that might or might not be true. Neither your character nor you know if it true or not. A Lie that is a conjecture is often _possibly_ true and the character's journey will consist of them proving that they were right to believe so from the start or learn the hard way that they were mistaken. The central question such a Lie poses is: Is this true?

> - "I am not worthy to inherit my master's workshop."
>
> - "The traitor who killed my father must die."

As you can see, the same phrase can be used either as a Truth or a Lie, though its meaning drastically shifts. As a Truth, `"The traitor who killed my father must die."` is a goal your character has that they will either fulfill or die trying. As a Lie, it is meant to be challenged as the story progresses. Does he indeed deserve to die? What did my father do that he was betrayed and murdered? Am I at fault for my father's death? These are all questions that only result from Lies, for they are meant to be challenged, not from Truths.

## Playing out the Story

In a way, the Lie is a lot more central to your character's story but the Truth is just as important, for it is what will drive them to press on when everything else tells them to give in.

Though it is implied that a Lie is always successfully challenged in the course of your character's story, so they may change for the better, it is totally legitimate to go on a lengthy journey only for your character to double down on his delusions, to refuse to face the Lie. Naturally, there will be no true happy end for such a character but that does not mean that the end to their story can not be fascinating and satisfying in its own way.



# Favor

**Favor** is a meta-currency you can spend to influence your dice rolls, tilt luck in your favor, or sometimes even fuel powerful magic. It is also part of the character progression.

Whenever the Truth or Lie really come out through how you roleplay your character or through the drama that results from your choices, you earn **1** Favor for your character.

There are other ways to earn Favor, for example by forgoing **XP** from a failed test, but playing out Truth and Lie will be your main revenues of Favor.



# Attributes

Each character has three **Attributes:** **Vigor,** **Intuition,** and **Reason.**

Each Attribute also has a numerical rating, which determines how many dice you roll when you test with that Attribute. The rating is an objective measure of your character's potential effort they can muster when doing tasks. For example, a bear has more Vigor than a mouse and a dragon even more than almost anything.

Each Attribute represents a different way for your characters approaches problems. How well do they coerce other people into giving them what they want or are they better at relating to others to form connections, or do they build up their case and negotiate? Do they rush in to face their enemies without fear, do they fade into the shadows when they skulk around instead, or how deftly outmaneuver them from a distance? How strong are they, how nimble, how clever?  
That is represented by your character's Attributes. Your character may approach any problem however they like but their attributes determine what they feel most comfortably doing, or perhaps even how flexible they are.

Your character's Attribute ratings are fundamental to they are and how they interact with the world and will change only marginally over the course of their story.

## Vigor

Vigor encompasses direct approaches to problem-solving.

  <figcaption>A warrior facing his enemy armoured in heavy steel and fiery courage.</figcaption>
</figure>

It's a matter of facing problems head-on, courageous, and with conviction always at your side. A matter of going all out to win it and to win big. As such, it is the Attribute most closely linked to the harnessing of fiery emotions.

Strength, endurance, tenacity, panache, ferocity, wealth, fame, and power of will are all different aspects of Vigor.

If your character has a high Vigor rating, they excel whenever they swing their mighty axe in a blinded rage, whenever they embolden their compatriots with a fiery speech, whenever they perform an impressive feat of strength, whenever they labor for hours on end at their forge, whenever they weave a heart-breaking tune on their lyre, whenever they shrug off a hit, or whenever they leverage their fame and wealth.


## Intuition

Intuition encompasses adaptive approaches to problem-solving.

  <figcaption>A hunting party tracking their prey, paying attention to every broken branch.</figcaption>
</figure>

It's a matter of utilizing opportunities in the moment and with the element of surprise always on your side. A matter of tipping the scales in your favour by paying close attention and going with the flow.

Flexibility, nimbleness, guile, reflexes, perceptiveness, wit, connections, and empathy are all different aspects of Intuition.

If your character has a high Intuition rating, they excel whenever they swirl their blade like a dervish, whenever they outfox their enemies with their silver tongue, whenever they dodge to safety at the lase possible moment, whenever they know exactly the right thing to say to empathize with people, whenever they craft an astounding piece of art, whenever they balance across a steep ravine without breaking a sweat, or whenever they know just the right person.


## Reason

Reason encompasses thoughtful approaches to problem-solving.

  <figcaption>A scholar, after years of research, finally figuring out what horror terrorizes the city.</figcaption>
</figure>


It's a matter of meeting problems on your own terms and with a contingency plan always by your side. A matter of knowing your enemies, their blindspots, and taking the time to masterfully exploit them.

Precision, deftness, intellect, foresight, research, industriousness, and rigor are all different aspects of Reason.

If your character has a high Reason rating, they excel whenever you fell the rider approaching from the horizon with a single arrow, whenever you facilitate genuine understanding between warring parties, whenever you engineer a baffling mechanism, whenever doom misses you by a mile as you were expecting it, whenever you mend a grievous wound, whenever you find yourself in a race with fate one step ahead.


## Dice Modifiers

Each Attribute also has a unique dice modifier. To use an Attribute's dice modifier, you need to use a fitting [Trait](#traits). When you do, it will change a few things about how dice are rolled.

| Attribute        | Modifier Name | Effect                                 |
|-----------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Vigor**     | _Fervor_      | For each **6,** add an additional die. |
| **Intuition**      | _Fortune_     | Re-roll each die that comes up **1**.  |
| **Reason** | _Focus_       | May re-roll all dice once.             |

Here is an [Anydice](https://anydice.com/program/2b138) link for the corresponding probabilities.



# Skills

There are **6** Skills in total (see [Skill List](/skill-list) for more details):

Skills represent both an area of expertise, something a character may or may not be trained or even an expert in and a section of the game itself. Each adventure will be different but each adventure will consist of these **6** different types of challenges to varying degrees.

| Skill                                | Uses                                                     |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| [Influence](/skill-list#influence)   | Interacting with other people                            |
| [Fight](/skill-list#fight)           | Hurting others and defending from harm                   |
| [Maneuver](/skill-list#maneuver)     | Overcoming immediate physical obstacles                  |
| [Wilderness](/skill-list#wilderness) | Navigating and surviving the wild                        |
| [Craft](/skill-list#craft)           | Creating tools and structures; manual labour             |
| [Resources](/skill-list#resources)   | Leveraging wealth, connections, and sources of knowledge |

A Skill has a corresponding number denoting the character's training. The default is **6.** This number denotes what is the lowest number on a die that counts as a success when that character rolls that Skill.

- untrained, a character has **6** in the corresponding Skill
- trained, a character has **5+** in the Skill
- as an expert, a character has **4+**
- as a master, a character has **3+** (this is extremely rare)

Whenever the game calls for a test, it will always call for an Attribute and a Skill. The Attribute determines how many dice you roll and the Skill determines what faces of the dice result in a hit or a miss.

Whenever you do not succeed on a Skill test, you learn something new and gain experience. To be precise, you mark **1** **XP** (**1** **EX**perience **P**oint) for each hit you rolled for that Skill. Each Skill has a separate track for **XP** and at certain intervals, gaining **XP** will improve your training with the Skill.

Skills may also be enhanced by [Talents.](Talents)



# Traits

A **Trait** is a factual description about what makes your character extraordinary with mechanical weight.

A character may have a nice beard but if he has the `Magnificient Beard` Trait, he has such a great beard, you may use it to your benefit and even to your detriment for dramatic effect.

A Trait has a rating ranging from **1** to **3.**

By taking a Trait, a player signals to the group that they are interested in that particular part of the story or their character. The higher the rating of your Trait, the more they want the Trait to come up in the game. Consider this when choosing your own Traits. Think about what you want to experience during the game and try to model your character's Traits after the goal.

> Maro has the Trait `Exiled Sellsword of Gantha` with a rating of **2.** By taking this Trait, he let the group know quite a bit about what he wanted to experience with his character. His character is a sellsword, so he will mostly likely want to invoke the Trait during fights. His character is also from a place called Gantha from which he has been exiled. By putting both of these aspects of his character into one Trait, he also signals that those two stories are somehow interconnected.
>
> He could have also split the Trait in two such as `Exile of Gantha` and `Famed Sellsword` and given them different ratings, had one aspect been more important to him than the other or if they had nothing or little to do with each other in the story.



## Using Traits to your Benefit

When you test a skill, you may invoke one of your Traits, if the Trait is relevant to your current task, and it would sense for it to help you. For example, if you try to hit someone with your sword, and you have a Trait named `Legendary Blademaster`, naturally, you may invoke it.

When you invoke a Trait, you may use the dice modifier for the Attribute you are testing with.

If the Trait you invoke has a rating of **2,** you may use an additional dice modifier of different Attribute on that roll as well. You choose which of the two other dice modifiers you want to use.

If the Trait you invoke has a rating of **3,** you may use all dice modifiers of all Attributes on that roll. This is incredibly powerful.

You may only invoke a single of your Traits per test. If you have multiple Traits which might fit, you have to choose only one of them.

> Cyrene has the Trait `Drunkard` with a rating of **1.**
>
> During a drinking competition, she invokes it to explode the two **6s** she rolled, which, in the end, gives her just the edge she needs to emerge victorious.


## Using Traits to your Detriment

There are many reasons to use one of your Traits to your detriment. It can lead to great roleplaying moments, it can let you communicate who your character is and what their flaws are, it can be simply for fun, and it can lead to you earning more **XP.**

You may use any of your Traits to your detriment, as long as it makes sense that the Trait would in some way hinder you.

You may only use a Trait to either help or hinder you, not both. Also, as above, you may only use a single of your Traits per test to hinder you. If you have multiple Traits which might fit, you have to choose only one of them.

When you test a skill, you may add one of your Trait's rating to the difficulty, if it would make sense said Trait would hinder you at what you are trying to achieve. This might increase the amount of **XP** you will receive should you fail the test.

The GM may compel you to use one of your Traits to your detriment when it would be both appropriate and dramatic. You may decline to do so by spending Favor equal to the Trait's rating. If you accept, use the Trait to your detriment as you normally would.

A Trait may only hinder you on uncontested tests (see [Types of Tests](/skill-tests#types-of-tests)).

> When Cyrene tries to balance across a raging river, her `Drunkard` Trait hinders her, and she adds **1** to the difficulty, which results in her falling into the water where the river drags her downstream instead of succeeding. However, the whole debakel netted her **1** additional **XP.**


## Environmental Traits

Your character is not the only one to have Traits. Others characters also have Traits of their own (see [Contests](/skill-tests#contests)) and so does the environment itself, and you may use them to your advantage.

There are always plentiful Traits on your surroundings. Finding them is the easy part, making use of them requires a varying amount of creativity, depending on the circumstances. If it's a `Sunny Day`, then that is a Trait on the scene, so is a `Lively Atmosphere`, `Pouring Rain`, `Thick Forest`, and `Treacherous Swamps`. Most environmental Traits are implied by the GM's description of the scene but some may be stated outright or created by a PC or NPC.

Unless stated otherwise by the GM, all environmental Traits have a rating of **1.** Traits with rating **2** and **3** exist, but they are exceedingly rare.

When you test a skill, you may invoke **1** environmental Trait which is known to you by describing how you would leverage that Trait to your advantage. If the group agrees that your creative efforts would result in an advantage for you, add its rating as dice to your roll.

You may only invoke a single environmental Trait per test. If there are multiple fitting environmental Traits, you may only choose **1** of them.

Once you have invoked an environmental Trait during a scene, you may do so until the scene ends or the scene changes so that your previous description would no longer grant you an advantage without having to go into detail how you would leverage that Trait to your advantage.

> Maro is infiltrating an enemy outpost in the dark of night. The group agrees that he may invoke the implied `Moonless Night` Trait on the scene to gain **1** additional die when sneaking past the guards. As long as it remains night, he may add **1** additional die to his infiltration attempts.


## Discovering Traits

If you have a Trait, openly known Traits of places, creatures, or people connected to your area of expertise. You may ask the GM for this at any time, and you are invited to enrich the world with your descriptions of your character's experience any time you see fit.

> During their last adventure, Mare and Cyrene have crossed path with the robber king of Gantha and Maro got swept up in his character's past and now this robber king spells quite a bit of trouble. Though, as an `Exiled Sellsword of Gantha`, there is for sure something Maro knows about this robber king that might aid them in their struggle.

Depending on the rating of your Trait, different kinds of information are available to you of all places, creatures, or people connected to the Trait:

- **Rating 1+:** All known Traits, the highest Attribute, the best Skill, and Disposition.
- **Rating 2+:** In-depth knowledge of common subject areas; rough outlines of obscure facts; the lowest rated secret Trait, all Attributes, and the three best Skills.
- **Rating 3+:** Expert at the topic; solid knowledge of even obscure facts and occurrences; all secret Traits, as well as all Skills.

> As Maro's Trait `Exiled Sellsword of Gantha` has a rating of **2,** he knows of the robber king's Attributes and that his Reason is quite a lot higher than his.
>
> Fortunately, he also learns of the robber king's lowest rated secret Trait `Only goes out at Night` which has a rating of **1.** It is not much but if he harbors such a secret, perhaps there is more hiding beneath to surface. Time to do some research (see [Research](Resting#research)).


### Creating Traits

Alternatively, you may also suggest a new Traits for a place, a creature, or a person connected to one of your own Traits as long as the table agrees with your suggestion.

Most often, the GM will like your suggestion and add the Trait (or a variation of it) on their own volition with the rating of their choosing as a new Trait.

Alternatively, if the new Trait is a fitting and creative idea but would be a little _too_ convenient for your current predicament, the GM may ask you to spend **1** Favor to create the new Trait on the place, creature, or person with rating up to the rating of your own Trait.


## Empowering Traits

Any time you use a Trait, you may spend **1** Favor to increase the rating of that Trait by **1.** This effect only lasts for the context the Trait is used it.

You may also spend **1** Favor if you do not have a fitting Trait to temporarily act as if you had a fitting Trait with rating **1.**
