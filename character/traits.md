# Traits

A **Trait** is a factual description about what makes your character extraordinary with mechanical weight.

A character may have a nice beard but if he has the `Magnificient Beard` trait, he has such a great beard, you may use it to your benefit and even to your detriment for dramatic effect.

A trait has a rating ranging from **1** to **3.**

By taking a trait, a player signals to the group that they are interested in that particular part of the story or their character. The higher the rating of your trait, the more they want the trait to come up in the game. Consider this when choosing your own traits. Think about what you want to experience during the game and try to model your character's traits after the goal.

{: .important }
> Maro has the trait `Exiled Sellsword of Gantha` with a rating of **2.** By taking this trait, he let the group know quite a bit about what he wanted to experience with his character. His character is a sellsword, so he will mostly likely want to invoke the trait during fights. His character is also from a place called Gantha from which he has been exiled. By putting both of these aspects of his character into one trait, he also signals that those two stories are somehow interconnected.
>
> He could have also split the trait in two such as `Exile of Gantha` and `Famed Sellsword` and given them different ratings, had one aspect been more important to him than the other or if they had nothing or little to do with each other in the story.



## Using Traits to your Benefit

When you test a skill, you may invoke one of your traits, if the trait is relevant to your current task, and it would sense for it to help you. For example, if you try to hit someone with your sword, and you have a trait named `Legendary Blademaster`, naturally, you may invoke it.

When you invoke a trait, you may use the dice modifier for the attribute you are testing with.

If the trait you invoke has a rating of **2,** you may use an additional dice modifier of different attribute on that roll as well. You choose which of the two other dice modifiers you want to use.

If the trait you invoke has a rating of **3,** you may use all dice modifiers of all attributes on that roll. This is incredibly powerful.

You may only invoke a single of your traits per test. If you have multiple traits which might fit, you have to choose only one of them.

{: .important }
> Cyrene has the trait `Drunkard` with a rating of **1.**
>
> During a drinking competition, she invokes it to explode the two **6s** she rolled, which, in the end, gives her just the edge she needs to emerge victorious.


## Using Traits to your Detriment

There are many reasons to use one of your traits to your detriment. It can lead to great roleplaying moments, it can let you communicate who your character is and what their flaws are, it can be simply for fun, and it can lead to you earning more **XP.**

You may use any of your traits to your detriment, as long as it makes sense that the trait would in some way hinder you.

You may only use a trait to either help or hinder you, not both. Also, as above, you may only use a single of your traits per test to hinder you. If you have multiple traits which might fit, you have to choose only one of them.

When you test a skill, you may add one of your trait's rating to the difficulty, if it would make sense said trait would hinder you at what you are trying to achieve. This might increase the amount of **XP** you will receive should you fail the test.

The GM may suggest one of your traits to be used to your detriment when it would be both appropriate and dramatic. You may decline to do so by spending **1** Favor. If you accept, use the trait to your detriment as you normally would.

A trait may only hinder you on simple tests (see [Types of Tests](../playing-the-game/skill-tests/resolving-simple-tests)).

{: .important }
> When Cyrene tries to balance across a raging river, her `Drunkard` trait hinders her, and she adds **1** to the difficulty, which results in her falling into the water where the river drags her downstream instead of succeeding. However, the whole debakel netted her **1** additional **XP.**


## Empowering Traits

If the action you are trying to undertake aligns with the Truth you have chosen for your character, you may spend **1** Favor to temporarily increase the rating of a trait by **1** for the duration of a test.  
If you do not having a fitting trait when undertaking such an action, you may also spend **1** Favor to temporarily gain the benefits as if you had a fitting trait with rating **1.**
