# Conditions

Conditions are temporary but unavoidable negative consequences of when you suffer [Stress](#stress) your daring adventures. They will get in your way and, with time, fester if not looked after. And worst of all, they will help the blackguards who cross your way until you get rid of them.

Conditions have a number associated with them called their [Severity](#condition-severities). A conditions severity increases as you gain stress during your adventures.

Simple tests always have a minimum difficulty equal to the highest severity of your appropriate conditions. If an uncontested test already has a higher difficulty, your conditions do not increase it.

During contests, your opponents may use your conditions to their advantage. Your opponent's minimum effort when testing against you is equal to the highest severity of your appropriate conditions.  
You may use your opponents' conditions against them for minimum effort in the same way as your opponent's can use yours against you.

The rules on when a condition hinders you on which kind of test are supposed to be a solid foundation to operate on but by no means law set in stone. As conditions are named after the circumstance they were inflicted, a condition's name might suggest that it should be applicable in even broader circumstances.  
Mental conditions are a prime example that might hinder you in almost any circumstance, even if the condition is not major.
Or, for example, a social condition marking you as a wanted for a gruesome murder might even hinder you on Wilderness tests as the tales of your misdeeds travelled across the land and no one you meet on the road is willing to help you, even getting in your way, and you must keep from the travelled road.


# Condition Types

You have **1** slot for each a physical, mental, and social condition. When the rules call for an _appropriate_ condition, they reference the different types of conditions as not all conditions will hinder you on every test.

Your condition slots start of empty. Whenever you suffer stress of a certain type, mark the lowest available stress box in the slot of that type. If that slot had no stress boxes marked previously, name and add a condition into the slot (see [Stress](#stress)).


## Physical Conditions

These conditions encompass all types of physical trauma, bodily injury and weariness. A cut from a blade is a physical condition, so is exhaustion from excessive travelling, and so are sickness and poisoning.

Physical conditions hinder you on Fight, Maneuver, Wilderness, and Craft tests. Wounds nor exhaustion get in the way of your concentration and coordination.

While resting, you can mend physical conditions by testing Craft, though not all severities can be mended with all [Attributes](attributes).

- **Minor physical conditions can be mended with any attribute.**
- **Moderate physical conditions can be mended with Intuition and Reason.** Some sense for field dressing or at least attentive care are required for these kinds of wounds.
- **Major physical conditions can only be mended with Reason.** Practiced surgery is required to close these kinds of wounds.


## Mental Conditions

These conditions encompass all types of mental trauma, spiritual injury, and weariness of the mind. A biting insult to your character is a mental condition, so is exhaustion from excessive research, and so are fear and confusion.

Mental conditions hinder you on no tests, unless they are major, then they hinder you on all tests. There is no running from your delusions and greatest fears.

While resting, you can mend mental conditions by testing Influence, though not all severities can be mended with all attributes.

- **Minor mental conditions can be mended by Influence with any Approach.**
- **Moderate mental conditions can be mended by Influence with Vigor and Intuition but not by Reason.** Some sense of genuine compassion or at least a warming presence is required for these troubles.
- **Major mental conditions can only be mended by Influence with Intuition.** Heartfelt empathy is required to tackle these troubles.


## Social Conditions

These conditions encompass all types of debts, societal rejection, accusations and other injuries to your reputation. The result of a successful slander campaign is a social condition, so is seclusion (willing or otherwise) from larger society, and so are debts, and being covered in muck.

Social conditions hinder you on Influence and Resource tests. A horrendous reputation is an uphill battle wherever you might want to make yourself heard and being cut off from the currents of society strains your access to all its marvels.

While resting in a settlement, you can mend social conditions with Resource tests, though not all severities can be mended with all attributes.

- **Minor social conditions can be mended by Means with any Approach.**
- **Moderate social conditions can be mended by Means with Vigor and Reason but not by Intuition.** Fame, Wealth, rigorous bookkeeping, or a sound argument before a court are required to get out of these predicaments.
- **Major social conditions can only be mended by Means with Vigor.** Nobility, a made name, or chests of gold are required to get out of these predicaments.



# Stress

Each of your condition slots has **6** stress boxes that you can mark to absorb stress you suffer. Each box has a corresponding number which denotes how much stress than box absorbs when you mark it. You have **3** boxes which may absorb **1** stress each, **2** boxes which may absorb up to **2** stress each, and **2** box which may absorb up to **3** stress.

Whenever you suffer stress, mark an empty box in the corresponding condition slot, noting that it absorbed that stress. Stress you suffer must be entirely absorbed by a single box, you may not distribute stress between boxes.

Should you not have an empty box to absorb stress you suffered, you are in deep trouble.
You may spend Favor equal to the stress you suffered to get a new trait with rating equal to the amount of Favor spent which absorbs the stress for you. Name the trait to describe the permanent injury you suffered and escaped by a hair's breadth.
Otherwise, whatever has been gnawing at you, finally overwhelms you. Be it blood loss, drowning, permanent imprisonment, succumbing to sickness, execution, madness, or complete social ostracism, and you must retire your character.



# Condition Severities

The condition in a condition slot has a severity of **1** (minor), **2** (moderate), or **3** (major) depending on the highest stress box marked in it.

You can reduce the severity of your conditions by tending to them (see [Recovering](/playing-the-game/resting#recovering)). When a Condition's severity changes to **0**, it vanishes.


## Minor Conditions

A condition is minor if the highest marked stress box in its slot is **1.**

These conditions are minor inconveniences. Superficial cuts, bruised egos, a revolting appearance after days of adventuring, and similar troubles, that arise with living an interesting life, are minor conditions. Nothing that cannot heal or mend with even just a little resting.

As a simple test's difficulty is always at least **1** and most foes you will encounter will be armed, so these kinds of conditions are more nuisance than hindrance (unless they begin to pile up and fill your Condition slots).


## Moderate Conditions

A condition is moderate if highest marked stress box in its slot is **2.**

These conditions are moderate setbacks. Flesh wounds, enduring exhaustion, nightmare-inducing disturbances, being accused of a crime, and similar troubles are moderate conditions.


## Major Conditions

A condition is major if the **3** stress box is marked.

These conditions are grievous injuries which threaten to fester and prematurely end your journey should they not get immediate attention. Stab wounds to the gut, feverish sickness, debilitating delusions, complete ostracization, and similar threats to your character's life are major conditions.

### Appropriate conditions

The three different types of conditions hinder you on different tests. Of course, you can almost always voluntarily hinder yourself with your own conditions if the table finds it appropriate.

|                  | Physical Hinders | Mental Hinders |  Social Hinders  |

### Mending conditions

The three different types of conditions have restrictions with which skill and which attribute they can be mended.

[Leisure Structures](../running-the-game/settlements#leisure-structures) can give you additional options to get rid of your conditions but on the road or without help, these are the only ways to get rid of conditions.

|              |   Mending Physical   |   Mending Mental    |  Mending Social  |
|:------------:|:--------------------:|:-------------------:|:----------------:|
|  **Skill**   |      **Craft**       |    **Influence**    |    **Means**     |
|  **Minor**   |   {{ site.check }}   |  {{ site.check }}   | {{ site.check }} |
| **Moderate** | _Intuition & Reason_ | _Vigor & Intuition_ | _Vigor & Reason_ |
