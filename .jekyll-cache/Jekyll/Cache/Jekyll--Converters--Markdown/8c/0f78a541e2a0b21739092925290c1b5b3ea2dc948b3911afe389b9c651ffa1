<p>To play rpg-thingy you need one Game Master (<strong>GM</strong>) and a handful of players. Each player is responsible for one Player Character (<strong>PC</strong>) who exists in a fictional world. The GM’s role is to bring the fictional world alive with descriptions, obstacles and Non-Player Characters (<strong>NPCs</strong>).</p>

<p>The PCs interact with the situation and the world presented by the GM until it is no longer obvious how the current situation would be resolved and the group consults the dice (see <a href="#rolling-the-dice">Rolling the Dice</a>).</p>

<h1 id="gameplay-pillars">Gameplay Pillars</h1>

<p>In brief, the 5 pillars most important to playing rpg-thingy:</p>

</ul>

<h1 id="consulting-the-dice">Consulting the Dice</h1>

<p>rpg-thingy uses a <strong>d6</strong> dice pool system. So whenever the game calls for dice to be rolled, roll a handful of six-sided dice. Each die can either be a hit or a miss, depending on if its face shows at least a certain number. Counting up all hits gives you what the game calls <strong>Effort.</strong> More Effort is always better.</p>

<h2 id="when-to-roll">When to roll?</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, the dice are consulted when the outcome of the current situation is no longer obvious. The outcome of a situation is obvious, when you, for example, want to hit a training dummy, talk to your friends, or walk up a smooth wall. Either you either obviously can do what you want to or you obviously can’t.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you want to hit a baddie with your sword, bribe a guard, or try to walk across a tightrope, what you try to do is possible, but you don’t know how good the baddie is at fighting or how he fights when the sun is in his eyes, if the guard is crooked or dutiful and will accept your bribe, or you queasy your character feels when the wind tugs at them as they balance across the chasm.</p>

<p>It’s the moment we, as players, roll the dice to open a fleeting portal to the fictional world, so it may answer our questions.</p>

<p>When you consult the dice, the game calls it a test. A test has a difficulty, a number that defines how much Effort it takes to succeed on the test, otherwise the test is a failure.</p>

<p>When asking <em>“Is the outcome of this situation obvious?”,</em> context and your goal are both important. If the baddie you want to hit with your sword, for example, is asleep, then there is no need to consult the dice; it is obvious that you will hit. Knowledge the GM might have about the world or NPCs might also influence if a task is obvious. If the GM, for example, knows that the guard is crooked, no roll is needed if the bribe is sufficient. Of course, if the GM does not know if the bribe is sufficient, consult the dice.</p>

<p>Goals or context can also make trivial tasks not obvious. If you, for example, want to hit the training dummy to impress an onlooker, it may be obvious that you will hit the dummy, but it is not obvious if the onlooker will be impressed, so you consult the dice.</p>
